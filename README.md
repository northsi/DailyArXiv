| **[Controlled Parity of Cooper Pair Tunneling in a Hybrid Superconducting Qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11303v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Superconductivity from the Slater mode: Application to KTaO3 heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10903v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity has been observed for the 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of KTaO3 with other oxides, with a transition temperature about an order of magnitude higher than its 3d cousin SrTiO3. The superconducting transition temperature is strongly dependent on the orientation of the interface. Motivated by this observation, we study pairing due to exchange of the soft transverse optic phonon mode characteristic of quantum paraelectrics and use the resulting theory to comment on the nature of superconductivity of this 2DEG. We find (1) an orientation dependence consistent with experiment along with an anisotropic gap function, but (2) a BCS coupling constant that is smaller than needed and so must be augmented by contributions from other phonons to be consistent with the observed values of Tc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-momentum Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz microcavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10692v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effects of Integrated Heatsinking on Superconductivity in Tantalum Nitride Nanowires at the 300 Millimeter Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10480v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the superconducting properties of tantalum nitride (TaN) nanowires and TaN/copper (TaN/Cu) bilayer nanowires fabricated on 300 mm silicon wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. We evaluate how an integrated Cu heatsink modifies the superconducting response of TaN nanowires by improving thermal dissipation without significantly compromising key superconducting parameters. Through analysis of hysteresis in current-voltage curves, we demonstrate that Cu integration improves heat dissipation, supporting expectations of faster reset times in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), consistent with enhanced heat transfer away from the hot spot. Using the Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham (SBT) hotspot model, we quantify the Cu-enabled improvement in heat transfer as an approximately 100x increase in the SBT slope parameter beta and effective interfacial heat-transfer efficiency compared to TaN nanowires. The near-unity ratio of critical to retrapping current in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires provides another evidence of efficient heat removal enabled by the integrated Cu layer. Our results show a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 7 nm and a critical temperature of 4.1 K for 39 nm thick TaN nanowires. The nanowires show <5% variation in critical dimensions, room-temperature resistance, residual resistance ratio, critical temperature, and critical current across the 300 mm wafer for all measured linewidths, demonstrating excellent process uniformity and scalability. These results indicate the trade-offs between superconducting performance and heat-sinking efficiency in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires. They also underscore the viability of wafer-scale fabrication for fast, large-area SNSPD arrays for applications in photonic quantum computing, cosmology, and neuromorphic computing devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages; includes Supplementary Material</p></details> |

| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 34 figures.

| **[Emergent gauge flux in QED$_3$ with flavor chemical potential: application to magnetized U(1) Dirac spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08528v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We design a lattice model of a non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a "chiral flux" phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)m magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. In a different region of the phase diagram, strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20+12...</summary><p>20+12 pages, 11+6 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_χ$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_χ$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magentoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moiré Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré materials, we propose TMD moiré multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures. Supplementary material: 4 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+3 p...</summary><p>7+3 pages, 5+3 figures; updated</p></details> |

The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+3...</summary><p>4.5+3 pages, 2+1 figures</p></details> |

Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, almost published version, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |

We present a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) investigation of single-crystal RV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior. Heat capacity and $μ$SR measurements reveal distinct magnetic phase transitions below 4 K, confirming the emergence of long-range magnetic order in all compounds studied. The $μ$SR results further indicate persistent spin fluctuations within the magnetically ordered state down to 50 mK, reflected in reduced ordered moments obtained from hyperfine analysis of the heat capacity measurements. These findings uncover the coexistence of static and dynamic magnetism in V-based Kagome metals and emphasizing the key role of 4$f$-electron anisotropy in shaping their magnetic ground states. Compared with the Mn-based RMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ analogs, our results highlight the unique magnetism arising from the decoupled rare-earth sublattice and its interplay with the nonmagnetic V Kagome network.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 μV K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 μV K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cooperative concurrence of 4f and 3d flat bands in kagome heavy-fermion metal YbCr6Ge6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05829v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
