| **[Active-Learning Inspired $\textit{Ab Initio}$ Theory-Experiment Loop Approach for Management of Material Defects: Application to Superconducting Qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02544v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures (7 images)</p></details> |
| **[Simulation of the thermoelectric effect in a multi-metallic superconducting cavity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08285v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting radio frequency accelerating cavities made with different material layers, such as copper, Nb or Nb3Sn, are susceptible to thermoelectric effects due to differences in Seebeck coefficients between the metals. A temperature gradient across the surfaces can drive thermoelectric currents, which may impact the cavity performance. A layered Cu/Nb/Nb3Sn single cell cavity was tested with cryocoolers in 2022. Three heaters were mounted on the cavity surface at different locations and three single axis cryogenic fluxgate magnetometers were attached close to the cavity equator. A linear increase in the magnetic field was measured while increasing the heaters power. The cavity setup was analysed with COMSOL and the results showed a trend similar to that observed in the experiment. This contribution details the approach chosen for the simulation and some of the challenges encountered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08194v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unveiling Intrinsic Triplet Superconductivity in Noncentrosymmetric NbRe through Inverse Spin-Valve Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08110v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters</p></details> |
| **[Vortex structure and intervortex interaction in superconducting structures with intrinsic diode effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22209v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect can affect the structure, interactions and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex-antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07947v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular beam epitaxy enables the growth of thin film materials with novel properties and functionalities. Typically, the lattice constants of films and substrates are designed to match to minimise disorders and strains. However, significant lattice mismatches can result in higher-order epitaxy, where commensurate growth occurs with a period defined by integer multiples of the lattice constants. Despite its potential, higher-order epitaxy is rarely used to enhance material properties or induce emergent phenomena. Here, we report single-crystalline FeTe films grown via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals self-organised periodic interstitials near the interface, arising from higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction shows that the tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition in bulk FeTe is strongly suppressed. Remarkably, these films exhibit substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity, likely due to suppressed monoclinic distortion. These findings demonstrate the potential of higher-order epitaxy as a tool to control materials and inducing emergent phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aluminum-Based Superconducting Tunnel Junction Sensors for Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07792v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The BeEST experiment is searching for sub-MeV sterile neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoil energies from the decay of $^7$Be implanted into superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The recoil spectra are affected by interactions between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution, but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser. These results establish Al-STJs as viable detectors for systematic material studies in the BeEST experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, presented at the 21st Low Temperature Detectors Conference</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting meander-line surface coil for NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07679v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples. Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for studying atomically thin materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Physical Review Applied</p></details> |

They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of pair-density-wave states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07506v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional $d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

| **[P-adic numbers and kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15377v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function by constructing a kernel representation of the Primon gas based on a finite p-base, thereby establishing a concrete link between number theory and kernel theory.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Ergodicity Breaking and High-Dimensional Chaos in Random Recurrent Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07932v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neural model introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS) nearly four decades ago has become a paradigmatic framework for studying complex dynamics in random recurrent networks. In its original formulation, with balanced positive and negative couplings, the model exhibits two phases: a quiescent regime, where all activity ceases, and a regime of ongoing irregular collective activity, termed asynchronous chaos (AC), in which state variables fluctuate strongly in time and across units but average to zero across the network. Building on recent work, we analyze an extension of the SCS model that breaks this coupling balance, yielding a richer phase diagram. In addition to the classical quiescent and AC phases, two additional regimes emerge, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the persistent-activity (PA) phase, each unit settles into a distinct, stable activation state. In the synchronous-chaotic (SC) phase, dynamics remain irregular and chaotic but fluctuate around a nonzero mean, generating sustained long-time autocorrelations. Using analytical techniques based on dynamical mean-field theory, complemented by extensive numerical simulations, we show how structural disorder gives rise to symmetry and ergodicity breaking. Remarkably, the resulting phase diagram closely parallels that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model, with the onset of the SC phase coinciding with the transition associated with replica-symmetry breaking. All key features of spin glasses, including ergodicity breaking, have clear counterparts in this recurrent network context, albeit with crucial idiosyncratic differences, highlighting a unified perspective on complexity in disordered systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum effects in rotationally invariant spin glass models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18034v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Satisfaction and Violation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation in spin ice materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12548v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We test the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in spin ice materials Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by measuring both the magnetic noise and the out-of-phase part of the susceptibility and comparing their ratio. We show that it is satisfied at temperatures well into the non-ergodic region below 600 mK, indicating local equilibrium. In both materials, below 400 mK, low frequency violations develop, showing an excess of noise as in spin glasses, with a frequency threshold of 0.1 Hz. New relaxation pathways and aging properties are unveiled in this frequency range in the ac susceptibility. The FDR remains valid at higher frequencies down to 150 mK.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 19 figures (main text: 6 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05286v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 1 table + 21 pages, 14 figures. v3: close to published version</p></details> |

The heterostacks are described using realistic structural relaxations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and their transport properties are computed for both pristine and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. Owing to the weak interlayer coupling, we resolve the hybridization between magic-angle flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are modified in distinct ways across low- and high-energy windows, revealing a new hybrid electronic regime to explore.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Surface band-selective moiré effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07704v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of 25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moir\'e effects.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Strong interlayer coupling and chiral flat-band cascades in twisted bilayer gratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07381v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moir\'e systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 extended figures, supplementary materials</p></details> |

We report hallmarks of topological protection at the Landau level filling factor v=7/11 in a two-dimensional electron system. The $\nu=7/11$ filling factor is the particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=4/11$, a filling factor intensely studied for the possibility of realizing unconventional electronic correlations. Our data establishes a new instance for an unusual fractional quantum Hall state and opens up possibilities for the study of unconventional correlations in an enlarged parameter space. We report and discuss transport signatures developing at other filling factors of interest $\nu= 11/17$, $5/8$, and $8/13$, which however in our sample do not exhibit topological protection.</p></details> |  |

However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + Supplementary</p></details> |

The spectra reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario.

| **[Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03530v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p></details> |  |

We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures; close to published version</p></details> |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 95 references, Supplemental Material with additional figure and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
| **[Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07383v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Phonon Hall Viscosity and the Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect of $α$-RuCl$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06443v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Kitaev honeycomb model on a neutral-atom quantum computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18554v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 3 code listings</p></details> |
| **[Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version: 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Experimental observation of frustration and large anomalous Nernst effect in metallo-molecular spin Kondo lattice interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04824v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16758v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04326v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and feedback are warmly welcomed.

| **[More bridging ligands activate direct exchange: the case of anisotropic Kitaev effective magnetic interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04149v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A magnet is a collection of magnetic moments. How those interact is determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely on $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping. Analyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and multi-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg edge-sharing systems.</p></details> |  |
