| **[Finite-momentum Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz microcavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10692v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effects of Integrated Heatsinking on Superconductivity in Tantalum Nitride Nanowires at the 300 Millimeter Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10480v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the superconducting properties of tantalum nitride (TaN) nanowires and TaN/copper (TaN/Cu) bilayer nanowires fabricated on 300 mm silicon wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. We evaluate how an integrated Cu heatsink modifies the superconducting response of TaN nanowires by improving thermal dissipation without significantly compromising key superconducting parameters. Through analysis of hysteresis in current-voltage curves, we demonstrate that Cu integration improves heat dissipation, supporting expectations of faster reset times in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), consistent with enhanced heat transfer away from the hot spot. Using the Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham (SBT) hotspot model, we quantify the Cu-enabled improvement in heat transfer as an approximately 100x increase in the SBT slope parameter beta and effective interfacial heat-transfer efficiency compared to TaN nanowires. The near-unity ratio of critical to retrapping current in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires provides another evidence of efficient heat removal enabled by the integrated Cu layer. Our results show a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 7 nm and a critical temperature of 4.1 K for 39 nm thick TaN nanowires. The nanowires show <5% variation in critical dimensions, room-temperature resistance, residual resistance ratio, critical temperature, and critical current across the 300 mm wafer for all measured linewidths, demonstrating excellent process uniformity and scalability. These results indicate the trade-offs between superconducting performance and heat-sinking efficiency in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires. They also underscore the viability of wafer-scale fabrication for fast, large-area SNSPD arrays for applications in photonic quantum computing, cosmology, and neuromorphic computing devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages; includes Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Orbital Separation of Charge Order and Superconductivity in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01643v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Non-Hermitian topological superconductivity with symmetry-enriched spectral and eigenstate features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23177v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure, and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to novel topological phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 22 figures; revised version accepted for publication in Phys.

| **[Design, Fabrication and Testing of a D-Shaped High Temperature Superconducting Magnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10295v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized. The fabrication feasibility of a D-shaped coil for this toroidal configuration also envisaged using stacked high-temperature superconducting cable. In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.</p></details> |  |

| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+3 p...</summary><p>7+3 pages, 5+3 figures; updated</p></details> |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 32 figures.

| **[Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+3...</summary><p>4.5+3 pages, 2+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Role of Disorder in Governing the Magnetic Properties of Cu2IrO3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07379v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is a honeycomb iridate which has been studied recently as a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, improved analysis of the INS spectra</p></details> |
| **[Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298v4)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_τ V_s)$, where $N_τ$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_τV_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_τ\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+5 ...</summary><p>13+5 pages, 6+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the finite-doping sign problem is evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We compute quantum oscillations in the density of states, and predict signatures of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates, despite the absence of hole pockets in photoemission and STM. A regime with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order is needed, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order. We also note distinctive features of the theory in the electron spectral function above the Fermi energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures. v5 Added co-author and predictions for electronic spectrum above the Fermi energy</p></details> |

At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, almost published version, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |

We present a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) investigation of single-crystal RV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior. Heat capacity and $μ$SR measurements reveal distinct magnetic phase transitions below 4 K, confirming the emergence of long-range magnetic order in all compounds studied. The $μ$SR results further indicate persistent spin fluctuations within the magnetically ordered state down to 50 mK, reflected in reduced ordered moments obtained from hyperfine analysis of the heat capacity measurements. These findings uncover the coexistence of static and dynamic magnetism in V-based Kagome metals and emphasizing the key role of 4$f$-electron anisotropy in shaping their magnetic ground states.

Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 μV K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 μV K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in distorted kagome GdTi3Bi4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07578v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cooperative concurrence of 4f and 3d flat bands in kagome heavy-fermion metal YbCr6Ge6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05829v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05735v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
