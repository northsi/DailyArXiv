| **[Conveyor-belt superconducting quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11782v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures and supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity under pressure in the two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion metal CeSiI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18476v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Plasmon assisted superconductivity in LiTi$_2$O$_4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18472v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We combine $GW$ plus extended dynamical mean field theory ($GW$+EDMFT) with the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT) framework to study the electronic properties of LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for the density of states, mass enhancement, Sommerfeld coefficient and superconducting $T_c$, if the dynamical nature of the screened Coulomb interaction is taken into account. Our results show that the coupling to collective charge fluctuations (plasmons) plays an important role in the pairing mechanism and explains the remarkably high $T_c$ of this moderately correlated spinel compound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting integrated on-demand quantum memory with microwave pulse preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02570v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $μs$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. Still the device was used only for storing finite-duration near-single-photon classical microwave pulses, we assert that it operates as a linear device when the photon population in the common resonator remains low so it should be compatible with quantum state storage.The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing magnetic coupling in lumped element superconducting resonators for molecular spin qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00857v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to $100$ kHz and collective couplings exceeding $10$ MHz. The resonators interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single wire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process gives access to the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a $50$ nm wide constriction at the inductor center, single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by sideband frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Prediction of superconductivity in mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07729v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study density-balanced, mass-asymmetric electron-hole bilayers as a tunable platform for correlated quantum phases. With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: 7...</summary><p>v2: 7 + 7 pages, 4 + 8 figures.

| **[Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>journ...</summary><p>journal accepted version, figures more readable, two comments added</p></details> |

| **[Intermediate Field Spin(on) Dynamics in $α$-RuCl$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16850v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present comprehensive inelastic neutron spectroscopic maps of the magnetic field-induced disordered phase of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$. For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $α$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplemental data is available upon request</p></details> |

TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 4 code listings</p></details> |
| **[Exactly solvable topological phase transition in a quantum dimer model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+6 p...</summary><p>5+6 pages, 8+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Strain-tunable magnetic correlations in spin liquid candidate Nb$_3$Cl$_8$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14524v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic field induced phenomena in Kitaev spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14496v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.</p></details> | 51 pages |

We find that at a given magnetization, the optimal candidate state has a finite flux chosen such that the spinon filling lies in a $|C|=1$ Landau-level gap: it gives the lowest variational energy and the smallest energy variance within our correlation-matrix reconstruction for local Heisenberg-type models. By symmetry, we argue that the finite gauge flux results in a non-zero (staggered) scalar spin chirality, as also numerically observed, and further find that the $|C|=1$ state exhibits dominant quasi-long-ranged $120^\circ$ magnetic correlations. Studying the next-to-optimal wavefunction with a $|C|=2$ Landau-level gap, we observe unusual spin-nematic correlations. Our results may provide guidance for analyzing the magnetic-field response of DSL candidate materials and offer numerical diagnostics that can connect to the underlying theory of spinons coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures; Supplementary Materials: 7 pages</p></details> |

These materials, which often appear as ultrathin, platelet-shaped crystals, are known for exotic phenomena such as superconductivity, topological order and quantum spin liquid. However, these crystals seldom reach macroscopic dimensions, making them unsuitable for conventional dilatometry techniques. By introducing a modified sample-mounting configuration, our design enables high-resolution measurements of thermal expansion and magnetostriction along in-plane crystallographic directions in samples with thicknesses well below 500 $μ$m. Validation measurements using a Quantum Design PPMS system confirm reliable performance for a 300 $μ$m-thick silver platelet, relatively hard ferromagnetic EuB$_6$ single crystals down to 50 $μ$m, and a 40 $μ$m-thin, soft AgCrS$_2$ single crystal. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The following article has been accepted by Rev.

While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 34 figures.

In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p></details> |  |

An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</p></details> |  |

In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Non-Hermitian Second-Order Topological Phases and Bipolar Skin Effect in Photonic Kagome Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12760v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures.

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</p></details> | 5 Figures |
| **[Spin Liquid Landscapes in the Kagome Lattice: A Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Chiral Heisenberg Model and Experimental Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09542v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral spin liquids, which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_χ$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_χ$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magentoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flat-band Ferromagnetism of SU$(N)$ Hubbard Model on the Kagome Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10549v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
