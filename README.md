| **[Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13303v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-energy spin waves as potential driving force for superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13180v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to fully utilize the technological potential of unconventional superconductors, an enhanced understanding of the superconducting mechanism is necessary. In the best performing superconductors, the cuprates, superconductivity is intimately linked with magnetism, although the details of this remain elusive. In search of clarity in the magnetism-superconductivity relationship, we focus on the electron-doped cuprate Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO(4-delta) (NCCO). NCCO has an antiferromagnetic ground state when synthesized, and only becomes superconducting after a reductive annealing process. This makes NCCO an ideal template to study how the magnetism differs in the superconducting and non-superconducting state, while keeping the material template as constant as possible. Using neutron spectroscopy, we reveal that the as-grown crystal exhibits a large energy gap in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum. Upon annealing, defects that are introduced by the commonly employed synthesis method, are removed and the gap is significantly reduced. While the energy gap in the annealed sample is an effect of superconductivity, we argue that the gap in the as-grown sample is caused by the absence of long-wavelength spin waves. The defects in as-grown NCCO thus play the dual role of suppressing both superconductivity and low-energy spin waves, highlighting the connection between these two phenomena.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12988v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an SU(2)xU(1) Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary electromagnetic current and the spin current made of the magnons) which could explain the conversion between the charge and spin currents, and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Observation of d-Wave Superconducting Gap Symmetry in Pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta Single Crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12606v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressure-stabilized bulk La3Ni2O7-delta, with a critical temperature (Tc) exceeding 77 K, has opened a new frontier in high-temperature superconductivity research beyond cuprates. Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Revealing superconducting gap in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$δ$ by Andreev reflection spectroscopy under high pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12601v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of compressed superconductivity at 80~K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ has brought nickelates into the family of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 pages |

Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at GoMACTech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Putting a new spin on the incommensurate Kekulé spiral: from spin-valley locking and collective modes to fermiology and implications for superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12320v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and [symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted incommensurate Kekul\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications of these results for superconductivity.</p></details> | 22 + 9 pages |

| **[High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12202v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus references, 4 figures; supplemental materials, 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08381v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 56 figures.

| **[Time-dependent correlations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter above the spin-glass transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08955v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \times 10^{\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper with supplementary sections</p></details> |
| **[Finite Spinon Density-of-States in Triangular-Lattice Delafossite TlYbSe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the rare-earth delafossite compound TlYbSe$_2$ -- extending the search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated triangular lattice magnets. While the DC magnetisation suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several Kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetisation and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a quantum-disordered ground state. We observe a spin glass transition around ~30 mK at zero field, arguably originating from a small fraction of free spins -- with an associated entropy of <3 % of the total $R\ln2$, which is suppressed by an applied field of ~0.02 T. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K is indicative of short-range spin correlations. Below 350 mK, we observe a robust linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, accompanied by the complete absence of long-range order at low fields. We propose that a phenomenological theory, based on the interplay between spinons and thermally excited gauge flux excitations, can account for the linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and could be widely applicable to similar critical quantum spin liquid candidate materials. The results establish the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe$_2$ as a prime candidate for field-tunable triangular quantum spin liquid behavior and highlight the importance of thermally excited gauge field excitations.</p></details> |  |

We utilize three approaches: statistical analysis and bias quantification of a human evaluation survey, information retrieval from real human-written versus AI-generated text data using cosine similarity as a comparison metric, and mathematical spin glass model and simulation. We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability. Our work inspires utilizing spin glass theory for the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, especially under environmental stochasticity from human interactions, with justification from real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10760v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta>0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: results improved by dropping the non flatness of free energy condition.

| **[Envelope representation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20610v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages; journal version</p></details> |
| **[Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</p></details> | 29 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03022v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical aging is one of the non-equilibrium phenomena where physical properties change over time due to structural relaxation. Aging in spin glass systems has been explained by a trap model on the temperature-independent energy landscape. Meanwhile, in the free energy landscape (FEL) approach to aging phenomena, it is assumed that the FEL responds to temperature changes with a time delay. In this paper, aging in a glass forming model in which both the trapping effect and the delayed response of the FEL exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript |

| **[Relaxation and Its Effects on Electronic Structure in Twisted Systems: An Analytical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13114v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice relaxation profoundly reshapes electronic structures in twisted materials. Prevailing treatments, however, typically rely on large-scale density functional theory (DFT), which is computationally costly and mechanistically opaque. Here, we develop a unified analytical framework to overcome these limitations. From continuum elastic theory, we derive closed-form solutions for both in-plane and out-of-plane relaxation fields. We further introduce an analytical phase factor expansion theory that maps relaxation into the electronic Hamiltonian. By applying this framework, the relaxation-mediated single-particle and many-body topological phase transitions in twisted MoTe$_{2}$ is accurately captured, and the evolution of flat bands in magic-angle graphene is quantitatively reproduced. Our work transforms the research of moir\'e relaxation from black-box numerical fitting to an analytical paradigm, offering fundamental insights, exceptional efficiency, and general applicability to a wide range of twisted materials.</p></details> | 29 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Observation of Fully Flat Bands in a Photonic Dipolar Kagome Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12843v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat bands, characterized by zero group velocity and strong energy localization, enable interaction-enhanced phenomena across both quantum and classical systems. Existing photonic flat-band implementations were limited to evanescent-wave systems, specific lattice symmetries, or complex supercell modulations. A simple, universal, and efficient approach to realizing flat bands without dedicated source excitation is to be explored. Here, inspired by geometrically frustrated configurations, we theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated threefold-degenerate flat bands by integrating orbital and rotational degrees of freedom in a photonic dipolar kagome lattice. By rotating the dipole orientation, the system exhibits a band flip transition at which point all bands achieve complete flatness and degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone. In contrast to conventional s-orbital kagome lattices with only a single flat band, our approach flattens the entire band structure, eliminating dispersive modes and enabling compatibility with arbitrary excitations. These results establish a new mechanism for flat-band engineering, offering a tunable strategy for enhancing light-matter interactions and may have applications in compact photonic devices and energy-efficient information processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</p></details> |  |
| **[-Continuum limit of bipartite lattices - The SSH model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11900v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schr\"odinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal dynamics of moiré excitons in van der Waals heterostructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11812v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\'e potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moir\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moir\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moir\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure characterized by flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena, such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and an augmented tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations indicate that spin-orbit coupling in LK-99 generates multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the Berry curvature distribution by further splitting the bands. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. The nonlinear Hall effect is solely due to the BCD, as the contributions from the Drude weight and quantum metric are zero due to time reversal symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In this new version we have added new results of non linear hall conductivity contributed from Berry Curvature Dipole</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Quantum Clusters in Kagome Weyl Semimetal Co3Sn2S2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11230v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impurities and intrinsic point defects, which profoundly influence spin, charge, and topological degrees of freedom, are crucial parameters for tuning quantum states in quantum materials. The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with its strong spin-orbit coupling, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and kagome lattice of correlated electrons, provides a compelling platform for studying impurity excited states. Yet, the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping its quantum states remains elusive. Here, we uncover intrinsic quantum clusters-localized intrinsic point defects that act as tunable quantum perturbations capable of reshaping electronic states and order parameters, on the surface of Co3Sn2S2 via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non contact atomic force microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters are identified as native oxygen defects that dominate the intrinsic defect landscape on both cleaved surface terminations. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow sites between three Sn atoms, and tune the flat band near the Fermi level, which exhibits orbital magnetism induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials reside slightly off center relative to the S lattice and generate occupied impurity states that retain sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduce to C2 symmetry at lower energies. In contrast, these impurity states show no measurable magnetic response. Our findings establish that intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution from Topological Dirac Metal to Flat-band-Induced Antiferromagnet in Layered KxNi4S2 (0<=x<=1)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09903v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 <= x <= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational search for materials having a giant anomalous Hall effect in the pyrochlore and spinel crystal structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18320v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ambient-pressure superconductivity and electronic structures of engineered hybrid nickelate films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03502v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.</p></details> |  |
