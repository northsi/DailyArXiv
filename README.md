| **[Mapping reservoir-enhanced superconductivity to near-long-range magnetic order in the undoped 1D Anderson- and Kondo-lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11153v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $ν= 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $ν= 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moiré materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages main text + 9 pages Appendix and References; 7 + 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spatial homogeneity of superconducting order parameter in NbN films grown by atomic layer deposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10839v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their high kinetic inductance, highly disordered superconducting thin films are a potential hardware for the realization of compact, low-noise elements in cryoelectronic applications. However, high disorder typically results in structural defects that cause spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter, thereby impairing the film's properties. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size. At the same time, the films achieve a relatively high sheet resistance (up to 1400 Ohm) and, consequently, a high sheet kinetic inductance (up to approximately 200 pH), making them well-suited for applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in strongly correlated systems for local repulsive interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10351v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is an interesting and important subject in condensed matter physics. Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[Magneto-optical study of Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10010v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the recognized sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits, the spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting state and the possible presence of magnetic-flux vortices remain comparatively underexplored. Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized.</p></details> |  |

Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 15 figures |

In particular, we obtain the explicit form of the phonon modes and construct the coupling Hamiltonians based on $D_{3d}$ symmetry. We then systematically compute the Raman intensity and show that the spin-phonon coupling renormalizes phonon propagators and generates the salient Fano linshape. We find that the temperature evolution of the Fano lineshape displays two crossovers, and the low temperature crossover shows pronounced magnetic field dependence. We thus identify the observable effect of the Majorana fermions and the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes encoded in the Fano lineshape. Our results explain several phonon Raman scattering experiments in the candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entangled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled quantum paramagnetic phases in the phase diagram, which in the absence of the magnetic field previously was predicted for more complex type of interaction. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground-state phases of $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg models on the body-centered cubic lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10008v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09709v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collective excitations in chiral spin liquid: chiral roton and long-wavelength nematic mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20702v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a elliptically polarized d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing entanglement at finite temperature: how does a "classical" paramagnet become a quantum spin liquid?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15144v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Hall to Chiral Spin Liquid transition in a Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19907v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $π$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+4 ...</summary><p>12+4 pages, 12+7 figures, minor changes, accepted version</p></details> |

Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version. 9 pages, 3 figures + 13 pages of Supplementary</p></details> |

Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Nature Physics</p></details> |

Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic loop-current bond order (NLCBO) that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Examining an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point, we find that frustration of the complex order-parameter phases leads to NLCBO. We further present conditions for overcoming other competing phases, including isotropic charge-bond and loop-current orders. Applying our findings to a previously studied model for $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$, we find that NLCBO emerges within a small region of phase space within mean-field theory. Our theory provides a microscopic description that goes beyond symmetry-allowed free-energy analyses and is broadly applicable to other Kagome metals featuring van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</p></details> |  |

In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</p></details> |  |

Our comprehensive study employs three approaches: the level-spectroscopy method, Monte Carlo simulations, and a machine-learning phase classification technique. In this system, we observe two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. We present a phase diagram consisting of three phases: the low-temperature ordered phase with sublattice magnetizations, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase, as a function of the ratio of the NNN interaction to the NN interaction. We verify the six-state clock universality through the machine-learning study, which uses data from the six-state clock model on the kagome lattice for training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator.

Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Kagome Superconductors YRu3B2 and LuRu3B2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16945v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $λ$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties in Mn- and Co-alloyed ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24564v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, APL Materials 14, 011114 (2026)</p></details> |
| **[Competing Ordering Modes in the Distorted Quantum Kagome Material Clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21024v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
