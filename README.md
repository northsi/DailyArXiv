This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00563v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.</p></details> | <details><summary>The R...</summary><p>The RF data quality for MgB2 in magnetic fields was improved</p></details> |
| **[Percolative Pathway to Stripe Order in KTaO3-Based Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20013v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sensitivity of low dimensional superconductors to fluctuations gives rise to emergent behaviors beyond the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer framework. Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking. These findings identify disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two dimensional quantum materials.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Anyon superconductivity and plateau transitions in doped fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02108v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $ν_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $ν_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2, 5...</summary><p>v2, 5 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Boost of critical current density near quantum critical points in FeSe-Based superconductors with two superconducting domes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19050v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have identified two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors. It was discovered that each dome is accompanied by a distinct nematic quantum critical point (QCP): one associated with a pure nematic QCP, and the other with a nematic QCP entangled with antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe. The mechanisms of vortex pinning and the influence of quantum critical fluctuations have been extensively explored, emphasizing the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations in modulating $J_{\rm{c}}$. Additionally, an increase in $J_{\rm{c}}$ was also noted near FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$, where its origin has been explored and discussed. This finding provides crucial clues about the existence of an ordered phase endpoint beneath the superconducting dome, offering an initial basis for further investigation into the potential presence of a QCP beneath it.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Temperature-Induced Superconductivity Enhancement under Large Exchange Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19030v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Through a comprehensive free energy analysis, we demonstrate that finite temperature can simultaneously weaken superconductivity and mitigate spin polarization induced depairing, leading to potential non-monotonic temperature-dependent behaviors in superconductors subjected to large exchange fields. Remarkably, superconductivity can be counterintuitively enhanced by temperature when the Zeeman energy exceeds the superconducting order parameter, owing to the competition between thermal and magnetic effects. We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model. A detailed parameter analysis identifies the conditions under which this phenomenon emerges, suggesting that temperature-enhanced superconductivity may be observable in materials such as MgB2 and FeSe through transport and tunneling measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages and 4 figures for main text; 13 pages and 11 figures for Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Anomalous phase shift and superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions via thin films of rare-earth intermetallic magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18990v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) Josephson junctions (JJs) with an anomalous ground state phase shift $\varphi_0 \neq 0,π$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) enable the implementation of the zero-field Josephson diode effect with the possibility to control the diode efficiency and polarity. It is just as important that in this case $\varphi_0$ provides a coupling between the superconducting phase and the magnetization of the interlayer. Such $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs can be used for superconducting memory and logic circuit applications. Here we present the results of theoretical calculation of the current-phase relationship (CPR), exhibiting the Josephson diode effect and $\varphi_0\neq 0,π$, for a JJ through a specific magnetic material. As the interlayer of the JJ we consider an ultra-thin film of intermetallic lanthanide ($Ln$)-based compound $\mathrm{GdIr_2Si_2}$. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) methods and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the film, construct the effective tight-binding Hamiltonian, perfectly describing its electronic properties, and calculate CPR. The CPRs demonstrate a pronounced $\varphi_0$ of the order of unity and a pronounced Josephson diode effect with the diode efficiency $ \lesssim 0.3$. Moreover, the efficiency can be controlled via rotation of in-plane magnetization in the interlayer. The prospects for utilizing alternative magnetic $Ln$-based materials of the $LnT_2X_2$ family ($T$ is a transition metal and $X$ is a $p$-element from groups III-V) for the implementation in $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs are also discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18951v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competition between charge-density-wave and superconducting orders on eight-leg square Hubbard cylinders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18644v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The issue of whether $d$-wave superconductivity (SC) occurs in the square-lattice Hubbard model with $U$ of order of the bandwidth has been one of the most debated issues to emerge from the study of high temperature SC. Here, we report variational results on eight-leg cylinders with next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the range $-0.5 t \leq t'\leq 0.25 t$ with $U = 8t$ and $12t$ and doped hole concentrations $δ=1/12$ and $1/8$. For $t'\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures plus Supplemental Material.

| **[Tuning entanglement phases and topological memory in the measurement-only Kitaev model with single and multi-qubit checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20545v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Exact perturbative expansion of the transport coefficients of a normal low-temperature Fermi gas with contact interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+γk_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $γ$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20261v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $Γ$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $Γ$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $Γ$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+10 ...</summary><p>8+10 pages, 4+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Tuning magnetic interactions with nonequilibrium optical phonon populations: a theoretical study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21373v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically explore how light-driven optical phonons can be used to drive magnetic exchange interactions into interesting physical regimes by developing a general theory of spin-phonon pumping in magnetic insulators with non-equilibrium optical phonon distributions, focusing on the diabatic regime where phonon frequencies are much larger than the magnetic interactions. We present several applications of spin-phonon pumping two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg, XYZ and Kitaev models to examine what kind of further neighbor interactions and chiral fields can be generated, and how anisotropic couplings can be enhanced, showing that experimentally accessible non-equilibrium phonon distributions can generically drive significant frustration and realize a variety of spin liquid regimes. This effect is described for both direct and superexchange mechanisms, and we derive simple geometric rules for which phonon modes are ``spin-phonon'' active and for which magnetic interactions. Spin-phonon pumping provides an intriguing possibility for preferentially pumping specific magnetic interaction terms. In addition to generating further neighbor interactions, such pumping can lead to increased magnetic anisotropy for initially weakly anisotropic models, and selectively pumping the Kitaev-Heisenberg model can suppress undesirable Heisenberg terms while enhancing Kitaev interactions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Chiral spin liquid instability of the Kitaev honeycomb model with crystallographic defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19409v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb gapless spin liquid in the presence of Stone-Wales-type local lattice defects with odd-sided plaquettes. While the clean Kitaev model has no finite-temperature phase transitions, we find that introducing a finite defect density $n_d\approx 10^{-4}$--$10^{-2}$ produces a true phase transition with a sizeable $T_c \approx 2 n_d$ in units of the Kitaev exchange. The resulting non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid exhibits scalar spin chirality and electron orbital magnetization which peak near lattice defects. This disorder-driven instability relies on an emergent long range ferromagnetic interaction $r^{-γ}$ ($γ\approx 2.7$) between defect chiralities, mediated by the nearly-gapless fermions, with implications for topology generation in Dirac cones with fluctuating mass terms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Here we demonstrate a new approach to get single crystal micrometer-thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films with low damping through isolating and mitigating interfacial paramagnetic contributions of a paramagnetic substrate by a buffer-layer. The YIG films with the diamagnetic yttrium scandium gallium garnet buffer layer grown by liquid phase epitaxy on a gadolinium gallium substrate demonstrate homogeneity unprecedented for the thin planar YIG structures, yielding ferromagnetic resonance linewidths of 4.9 MHz at 4 K and 5.9 MHz at 16 mK, the lowest values reported to date.

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles.</p></details> |  |
| **[A non-equilibrium quantum transport framework for spintronic devices with dynamical correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18442v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-terminal spintronic devices remain challenging to model under realistic operating conditions, where the interplay of complex electronic structures, correlation effects and bias-driven non-equilibrium dynamics may significantly impact charge and spin transport. Existing {\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures.

Tuning an FB to the chemical potential could induce electronic instabilities and emergent orders. Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their role in emergent orders in bulk materials remains lacking. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and density functional theory, we show that the low-energy structure of the Cr-based kagome metal superconductor {\Cr} is dominated by FBs at the Fermi level. We also observe low-energy magnetic excitations evolving across the low-temperature transition, largely consistent with the FB shift. Our results suggest that the low-temperature order contains a magnetic origin and that the kagome FBs may play a role in the emergence of this order.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications 16, 7573 (2025). 11 pages, 4 main figures, 13 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17398v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, here we report the single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of similar compounds $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb), which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of the latter makes the structure orthorhombic the kagome net slightly distorted, and the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently: the Fe moments order above 400 K having, with ferromagnetic Kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while the rare-earth moments order below 9 K. While TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, which are strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveals three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a huge energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and actual 2D order of anti-aligned chains costs very little. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new possibilities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10976v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrons of $d$-symmetry interacting with a localized non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin order on a kagome lattice are considered. Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</p></details> | <details><summary>6.5 p...</summary><p>6.5 pages main text + 9 pages supplementary materials, additional details on the method used and results for more general case</p></details> |
| **[Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12731v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</p></details> | 64 pages, 31 figures |

The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we document an unexpected isosymmetric first-order magnetic transition in the recently synthesized frustrated kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Nd3ScBi5, which is characterized by significant latent heat and a pronounced magnetocaloric effect, as well as discontinuous Raman shifts and negligible hysteresis. Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+20...</summary><p>13+20 pages, 6+12 figures.

The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+12...</summary><p>12+12 pages, 5+7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Ultrafast symmetry modulation and induced magnetic excitation in the Kagome metal RbV3Sb5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06389v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</p></details> |  |
