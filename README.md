| **[Unconventional Superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ from the Perspective of Symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconductor $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high transition temperature ($T_{c}$) under high pressure. Shortly after this discovery, thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ was demonstrated to exhibit ambient-pressure superconductivity; however, the corresponding $T_c$ is only about half that of the pressurized bulk material. This striking difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing superconductivity in these two structures. To address this issue, we develop a symmetry-based method that investigates superconducting pairings solely based on experimentally determined symmetry and $T_c$, without assuming any specific superconducting parameters. Applying this approach, we find that both pressurized bulk and thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ exhibit $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing symmetry and two-gap superconductivity, yet their dominant microscopic origins are distinct. In the pressurized bulk, superconductivity is dominated by out-of-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, while in the thin film, in-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals prevails. Furthermore, the observed reduction in $T_c$ can be attributed to this transition of the dominant pairing types, driven by the decreased ratio of inter-layer to intra-layer hoppings in the thin film. Our result sheds lights on the microscopic pairings in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ and reveal the significance of the symmetry. This method can potentially be generalized to a broader range of unconventional superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting properties of Fibonacci chains with enhanced superconducting pairing at the boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02900v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03975v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments which report Kekul\'e ordering in the twisted graphene family, we develop a microscopic theory of superconductivity, specifically for the bi-layer case. This involves an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) which naturally incorporates a Kekul\'e distortion into the superconducting phase. The PDW state displays three central features: (i) it spontaneously breaks $C_3$ rotational symmetry, producing nematic order, and (ii) it possesses a large gap-to-critical-temperature ratio. Moreover, (iii) it yields a quasi-particle density of states having a V-like shape (with a finite value at zero energy) which transitions to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum with increasing attraction. These characteristics, including consistency with an allowed Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, align with key experimental signatures in the twisted graphene family where the U-V transition is observed in the tri-layer case. We find the paired state with a modest interaction strength is near to a BEC-like regime, as appears consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Together, these results establish a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW state as an essential ingredient towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in twisted graphene.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07131v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 +6...</summary><p>21 +6 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Hund's coupling assisted orbital-selective superconductivity in Ba1-xKxFe2As2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06435v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition. Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure, where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity of Incoherent Electrons near the Relativistic Mott Transition in Twisted Dirac Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06313v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent, allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the proximate insulating state.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

A detailed study of the current-voltage characteristics of the plasma was performed to optimize the superconducting critical temperature, Tc. The thickness dependence of Tc for the films deposited under different conditions was analyzed down to the ultrathin limit. Optimized films were used to fabricate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors which, at T=3.5 K, show saturated internal detection efficiency (IDE) up to a wavelength of 1301 nm and 95% IDE at 1548 nm with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in Applied Physics Letters</p></details> |
| **[Signatures of superconducting Higgs mode in irradiated Josephson junctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05730v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Higgs mode, originally proposed in the context of superconductivity, corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. Recent THz-domain optical studies have found signatures consistent with the Higgs mode, but its unambiguous detection is still challenging. We predict that the existence of the Higgs mode can be unambiguously revealed by standard measurements of the transport characteristics in microwave-irradiated asymmetric and transparent Josephson junctions. One signature of the Higgs mode in a Josephson junction is the microwave-induced enhancement of the second harmonic of the equilibrium current-phase relation (at zero DC bias voltage), whose sign differs from its expected value in the absence of the Higgs mode. As the radiation frequency is varied, this enhancement exhibits resonant behavior when the microwave frequency is tuned across the Higgs mass. The second signature that we propose is the enhancement of the second harmonic of the AC Josephson current at finite DC voltage bias, which can be probed in a customary analysis of the Shapiro steps in a microwave-irradiated junction.</p></details> |  |

We show that it is satisfied at temperatures well into the non-ergodic region below 600 mK, indicating local equilibrium. In both materials, below 400 mK, low frequency violations develop, showing an excess of noise as in spin glasses, with a frequency threshold of 0.1 Hz. New relaxation pathways and aging properties are unveiled in this frequency range in the ac susceptibility. The FDR remains valid at higher frequencies down to 150 mK.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 19 figures (main text: 6 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05286v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Percolation and criticality of systems with competing interactions on Bethe lattices: limitations and potential strengths of cluster schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02961v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The random clusters introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (FK) and analyzed by Coniglio and Klein (CK) for Ising and related models have led first Swendsen and Wang and then Wolff to formulate remarkably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes that weaken the critical slowing down. In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 1 table + 21 pages, 14 figures. v3: close to published version</p></details> |

One of the fundamental results of the theory is the Parisi formula, which identifies the limit of the free energy of a large class of such models. Yet many interesting models remain out of reach of the classical theory, and direct generalizations of the Parisi formula yield invalid predictions. I will report here on some partial progress towards the resolution of this problem, which also brings a new perspective on classical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; contribution to the proceedings of the ICM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Bias and Spectral Properties of Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24914v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Efficient Sampling of Three-Dimensional Spin Glasses and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23945v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |

We report hallmarks of topological protection at the Landau level filling factor v=7/11 in a two-dimensional electron system. The $\nu=7/11$ filling factor is the particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=4/11$, a filling factor intensely studied for the possibility of realizing unconventional electronic correlations. Our data establishes a new instance for an unusual fractional quantum Hall state and opens up possibilities for the study of unconventional correlations in an enlarged parameter space. We report and discuss transport signatures developing at other filling factors of interest $\nu= 11/17$, $5/8$, and $8/13$, which however in our sample do not exhibit topological protection.</p></details> |  |

However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + Supplementary</p></details> |

These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario.

| **[Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p></details> |  |

Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p></details> |  |

We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures; close to published version</p></details> |

Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p></details> |  |

In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Strong Correlations and Superconductivity in the Supermoiré Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24670v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supermoir\'e lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moir\'e patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moir\'e flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoir\'e lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoir\'e lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoir\'e mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoir\'e lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoir\'e lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moir\'e flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoir\'e lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.</p></details> |  |

While some studies attribute it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.</p></details> |  |

In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 3 code listings</p></details> |
| **[Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version: 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Experimental observation of frustration and large anomalous Nernst effect in metallo-molecular spin Kondo lattice interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04824v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16758v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04326v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and feedback are warmly welcomed.

| **[More bridging ligands activate direct exchange: the case of anisotropic Kitaev effective magnetic interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04149v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A magnet is a collection of magnetic moments. How those interact is determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely on $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping. Analyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and multi-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg edge-sharing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 84 references, Supplemental Material with additional figure and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
