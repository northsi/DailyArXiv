| **[Superconductivity in cubic La3Al with interstitial anionic electrons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22559v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the observation of superconductivity in cubic La3Al single crystal. It shows a metallic behavior at a normal state without observable structural transition and enters the superconducting state below Tc ~ 6.32 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that cubic La3Al is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor. Moreover, theoretical calculations show that it can host interstitial anionic electrons, which are located at the body center of cubic unit cell, and confirm the electron-phonon coupling as the superconducting mechamism. Thus, cubic La3Al can be regarded as an novel electride superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 page, 4 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Critical dynamics and superconducting state preparation in the quenched Kitaev chain with pairing imbalance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21540v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Preformed Cooper Pairing and the Uncondensed Normal-State Component in Phase-Fluctuating Cuprate Superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21133v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a self-consistent microscopic framework beyond mean-field theory for superconductivity in cuprates. It couples fermionic quasiparticles with collective phase dynamics to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid stiffness. The phase sector explicitly incorporates both smooth bosonic Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations, renormalized by long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type vortex-antivortex fluctuations. The required input is the correlated single-particle spectral function, enabling direct interfacing with Hubbard-type models. The framework provides quantitative access to key superconducting observables, including $T$-dependent gap and phase stiffness, gap-closing temperature $T_{\rm os}$, and transition temperature $T_c$, across wide ranges of doping. Using a recently proposed solvable interaction model as input, our simulations reveal several important features consistent with experimental observations in the cuprates: a $d$-wave superconducting dome in the $T$-$p$ phase diagram with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped regime, a pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{\rm os}$ signaling preformed Cooper pairing, a finite uncondensed normal component persisting even at $T=0$, and the onset temperature $T_{\rm on,vortex}$ of vortex signals, offering a consistent understanding of how strong correlations and phase fluctuations cooperate to shape high-$T_c$ superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Room-temperature superconductivity in ultra-thin carbon nanotube zeolite composites: a conventional or unconventional superconductor?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21120v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent report of signs of room-temperature superconductivity in ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) of types (2,1) and (3,0) holds significant promise for energy applications due to their ability to conduct current without dissipation. However, the McMillan Tc formula fails to calculate their superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) accurately, which raises an important question: what is the pairing mechanism driving their room-temperature superconductivity? To explore this further, we first investigate whether the strong curvature of ultrathin CNT leads to exotic phenomena in unconventional superconductors. If no evidence of these exotic characteristics is found and the McMillan formalism indicates that it is not a BCS-type superconductor, could we be observing a new class of unconventional superconductivity that functions independently of phonons and typical exotic features? In this paper, we demonstrate that factors such as the chiral angle of CNT, boron dopants and lattice regularity can be used to tune the theoretical Tc to experimental values. Our finding suggests that combining CNT with a harder substrate could be vital for further enhancing Tc while minimizing lattice distortion under doping. We propose a reconsideration of the common belief regarding whether the McMillan and BCS Tc formulas are adequate for classifying materials as BCS or non-BCS superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Field-resilient superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators made of Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20782v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators with high internal quality factors (\Q_i) are essential for quantum information applications, but suffer severe Qi degradation under magnetic fields due to quasiparticle generation and vortex-induced losses. We fabricated and characterized Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN SCPW resonators with varying film thicknesses under different temperatures and in-plane magnetic fields (\(B_{\parallel}\)). Temperature-dependent transmission measurements agree well with Mattis-Bardeen theory, revealing kinetic inductance parameters. Comparative analysis shows that 45-nm-thick NbTi resonators maintain \(Q_i = 1.01 \times 10^{4}\) at (\(B_{\parallel}\)) = 0.4 T, satisfying the dual requirements of high Qi and strong field resilience. Owing to its moderate kinetic inductance and compatibility with conventional photolithography, NbTi emerges as a practical material platform for field-resilient SCPW resonators and hybrid quantum circuits operating in magnetic environments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Ambient-pressure superconductivity above 22 K in hole-doped YB2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20742v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of hydrogen-dominant (superhydride) materials, such as LaH10 have led to putative discoveries of near-room temperature superconductivity at high pressures, with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 250 K observed at 170 GPa. While these findings are promising, achieving such high superconductivity requires challenging experimental conditions typically exceeding 100 GPa. In this study, we utilize first-principles calculations and Migdal-Eliashberg theory to examine the superconducting properties of the stable boron-based compound YB2 at atmospheric pressure, where yttrium and boron atoms form a layered structure. Our results indicate that YB2 exhibits a Tc of 2.14 K at 0 GPa. We find that doping with additional electrons (0 to 0.3) leads to a monotonic decrease in Tc as the electron concentration increases. Conversely, introducing holes significantly enhances Tc, raising it to 22.83 K. Although our findings do not surpass the superconducting temperature of the well-known MgB2, our doping strategy highlights a method for tuning electron-phonon coupling strength in metal borides. This insight could be valuable for future experi-mental applications. Overall, this study not only deepens our understanding of YB2 superconducting properties but also contributes to the ongoing search for high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Ferrimagnetic Ground State and Suppressed Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional HC6](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20672v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional hydrogenated graphene (HC6) represents a promising platform for exploring emergent electronic phases. Owing to its high electronic density of states at the Fermi level, HC6 is expected to support phonon-mediated superconductivity, with a calculated critical temperature Tc of 37.4 K in the paramagnetic metallic phase. However, spin-polarized first-principles calculations reveal that HC6 stabilizes in a ferrimagnetic ground state, which is energetically favored by 0.175 eV per unit cell over the paramagnetic metallic phase. This large energy difference significantly exceeds kB T at room temperature, indicating robust magnetic order. Although the superconducting condensation energy lowers the total energy by about 7 meV, the superconducting phase remains metastable. These results highlight the dominant role of magnetism in HC6 and illustrate how a high electronic density of states can drive competing instabilities in hydrogenated two-dimensional materials, offering design principles for carbon-based magnetic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effect of C additives with 0.5% in weight on structural, optical and superconducting properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high entropy alloy films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20650v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigated the superconducting (SC) properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high-entropy alloy (HEA) thin films with 0.5% weight C additives. The C additives stabilize the structural properties and enhance the SC critical properties, including $\mu_0$Hc$_2$ (13.45 T) and Tc (7.5 K). The reflectance of the C-added HEA film is enhanced in the low-energy region, resulting in a higher optical conductivity, which is consistent with the lower electrical resistivity. In addition, we observed SC vortices in the C-added HEA film using magnetic force microscopy. The magnetic penetration depths ($\lambda$) of the pure HEA and C-added HEA films were estimated from their Meissner force curves by comparing them with those of a reference Nb film. At 4.2 K, the {\lambda} of the C-added film is 360 nm, shorter than that of the pure HEA film (560 nm), indicating stronger superconductivity against an applied magnetic field.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High temperature superconductivity with giant pressure effect in 3D networks of boron doped ultra-thin carbon nanotubes in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19255v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.</p></details> |  |

| **[Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19006v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite, Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O, we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional crossover in quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; journal version</p></details> |
| **[A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20724v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments. These papers were `Theory of spin glasses' by S.F.Edwards and P.W.Anderson (EA)[1] and `Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass', by D.Sherrington and S.Kirkpatrick (SK)[2], both concerned with trying to understand recent experiments that suggested a new phase of matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12202v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus references, 4 figures; supplemental materials, 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08381v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 56 figures.

| **[Time-dependent correlations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter above the spin-glass transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08955v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \times 10^{\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper with supplementary sections</p></details> |

All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands, while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three (Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.</p></details> |  |

We used on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions obtained from a newly developed first-principles calculation method. Our calculations for systems up to eight layers give rise to electron-hole asymmetries, band flatness, band gaps, and layer anti-ferromagnetic ground states in keeping with available experiments. By including the intersite Hubbard interactions up to the next-nearest neighboring sites, the band gaps are shown to open when the number of layers is larger than three, while the trilayer system maintains its metallic nature with two low energy density of state peaks near the Fermi energy whose separation increases with the range of inter-site Hubbard parameters. Within our framework, the calculated band gaps reflect mean-field ground states with extended Hubbard interactions, in closer agreement with experimental estimates. The tight-binding formulation further enables efficient treatment of large rhombohedral chiral systems, including twisted multilayer graphene.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals, this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version and comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06721v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this review, we present recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are due to specific atomic order effects without electron interactions. These states are always indicative of some form of confinement and have consequences on the electronic properties. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene (TBG) or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms). We have shown that their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In the case of TBG, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on two-dimensional nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of 2D materials.</p></details> | review |

However, how the associated fluctuations influence the electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) to single-orbital systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+4 p...</summary><p>6+4 pages, 5+5 figures</p></details> |

Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

When the doping level of Se increases, the bandgaps of Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8 single crystals decrease gradually, accompanying with the expanded unit cells. The first-principles calculations show that there is a flat band (FB) near the Fermi level in bulk Pd3P2S8. This FB mainly originates from the dz2-like orbitals of Pd atoms in the Pd kagome lattice, which has a finite interlayer electron hopping perpendicular to the PdS4 square plane. The interlayer hopping can be reinforced with the Se doping, inducing a stronger interlayer coupling via the chalcogen atoms at apical sites, which reduces the bandgap and enhances the cleavage energy. In contrast, the vanishing interlayer hopping in the two-dimensional limit results in the formation of ultra-FB in the monolayers of these compounds. The easy exfoliation and the existence of unique ultra-FB near EF make Pd3P2(S1-xSex)8 a model system to explore the exotic physics of FB in two-dimensional kagome lattice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Anomalous Landau Levels in Inhomogeneous Fluxes and Emergent Supersymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20462v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic topological and charge-ordered phases.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03123v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</p></details> |  |

A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties of the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01048v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decades, magnetic frustration has been under intense debate due to its unusual properties. For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength. Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the kagome lattice.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin liquid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18845v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moiré Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures. Supplementary material: 4 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 24 figures.

| **[Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05336v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Magnetic Frustration in CuYbSe$_2$: an Yb-Based Triangular Lattice Selenide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17023v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Yb based triangular lattice delafossites $A$Yb$X_2$ ($A$ = alkali metal, $X$ = O, S, Se) have recently been studied as quantum spin liquid candidates. We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16758v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures including the supplemental materials</p></details> |
