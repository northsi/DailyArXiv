| **[Experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting quantum processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15576v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atomic Visualization of Bulk and Surface Superconductivity in Weyl Semimetal γ-PtBi2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15538v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A bulk superconductor hosting intrinsic surface superconductivity provides a unique platform to study Majorana bound states. The superconductor, trigonal γ-PtBi2, is a promising candidate, as surface superconducting gaps and topological surface states have been observed. However, the simultaneous presence of bulk and surface superconductivity has not been resolved. Here, we directly visualize coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in trigonal PtBi2 by using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The bulk gap is Δ ~ 0.053 meV with a critical temperature (Tc) ~ 0.5 K and a critical field below 0.01 T, accompanied by a vortex lattice and bound states, yielding a coherence length of ~200 nm. Remarkably, certain surface regions show a much larger gap of Δ ~ 0.42 meV, persisting up to Tc ~ 3 K and surviving magnetic fields up to 2 T, yet lacking a static vortex lattice. This coexistence of robust surface and bulk superconductivity establishes γ-PtBi2 as a unique platform for investigating the interplay between bulk and surface Cooper pairings in superconducting topological materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interplay of spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field enhances superconductivity in $LaAlO_3/KTaO_3$ (111)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15526v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying the structure of La3Ni2O7 in the pressurized superconducting state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15265v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic areas spread in two-dimensional Superconducting Quantum Interference Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15020v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), formed by incorporating Josephson junctions into loops of superconducting material, are the backbone of many modern quantum sensing systems. It has been demonstrated that, by combining multiple SQUID loops into a two-dimensional (2D) array, it is possible to fabricate ultra-high-performing Radio frequency sensors. However, to function as absolute magnetometers, current-in-use arrays require the area of each SQUID loop in the array to be incommensurate and, in turn, forbid the achievement of their full potential in terms of quantum-limited performances. This is because imposing incommensurability in the areas contrasts with optimised performance in each single SQUID loop. In this work, we report that by selectively inserting bare sections of a superconducting circuit with no Josephson junctions, 2D SQUID arrays can operate as an absolute magnetometer even when no physical area spread is applied. Based on a generalisation of current available theories, a complete analytical formulation for the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution of these bare loops and what we call a synthetic area spread is unveiled. This synthetic spread represents the equivalent physical spread of incommensurate SQUID loops that you will use to obtain the absolute Voltage-Magnetic Flux response if no bare loops were in use. Our work opens the way to a broader use of this technology for the fabrication of ultra-high-performance absolute quantum sensors. Our approach is also experimentally verified by fabricating several 2D SQUID arrays incorporating bare superconducting loops and by demonstrating that they behave in alignment with what is suggested by our theory.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figure |
| **[Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21029v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04629v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.</p></details> | 42 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Effects of the Next-Nearest-Neighbor Hopping on the Low-Dimensional Hubbard Model: Ferromagnetism, Antiferromagnetism, and Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13534v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Two-Dimensional Superconducting BKT Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13486v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional superconductors undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by vortex-antivortex unbinding, yet experimental signatures beyond transport remain limited. Here, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation rate provides a direct probe of this transition. In a 2-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor, $1/T_1T$ develops a Hebel-Slichter-like peak around $T_{\rm{BKT}}$, originating from the emergence of coherence peaks in the density of states, while no peak appears at the pair formation scale $T_{\rm{BCS}}$. We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13508v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: modeling with experimental validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the sum of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium, with the scattering $S$ coefficient further modulated by the anisotropy factor $g$. The effect of the particulate medium is incorporated through an effective refractive index. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16788v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the future with magnons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06382v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17668v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each component following Suzuki--Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes--Suzuki--Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Nonreciprocal Spin-Glass Transition and Aging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17360v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disordered systems generically exhibit aging and a glass transition. Previous studies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness. Here, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical Sherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between two identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition from a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as non-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Evidence of de Almeida-Thouless line below six dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $θ= 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($σ_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

We derive and resolve algebraic constraints on the exchange constants ensuring the appearance of a flat band in the one-magnon spectrum. The properties of the corresponding flat magnon bands and localized magnon states are analyzed. We further construct the mapping of the flat-band conditions for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constants onto the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky parameters. Based on the mapping the possibility of the electric field driven flat bands with aid of the magnetoelectric coupling is examined.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.</p></details> |  |

This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, one table</p></details> |

We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13831v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $α$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $α$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 + ...</summary><p>15 + 26 pages, 5 + 12 figures</p></details> |

The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $α$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15604v3)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Most research in solid-state systems has focused on the use of AC-electric fields as the controlling drive. In this study, we investigate the effects of AC-magnetic fields on two-dimensional (2D) Dirac electrons and report the emergence of new states and new transport phenomena. In a magnetic field that temporarily changes its direction, the 2D Dirac electrons form a new localized state with a flat band dispersion, dubbed as a $π$-Landau level. Its wave function is a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise cyclotron orbits with time-periodic amplitudes, resulting in a novel closed trajectory shaped like a figure eight. Then, what would be the counterpart of the Hall effect in AC-magnetic fields? We find that a DC-current in the transverse direction, i.e. a homodyne Hall current, is generated when an additional AC-electric field is applied. In the case of Dirac electrons, several electronic states contribute to this phenomenon including the $π$-Landau level. However, when the chemical potential $μ$ is near the Dirac point, the dominant contribution comes from the low-energy electrons and we numerically find the homodyne Hall current to behave as $I_y=-\frac{e}{h}μ$ per valley and spin. We explain this phenomenon through the high-frequency effective Floquet Hamiltonian which resembles the chiral Landau level Hamiltonian of three-dimensional Weyl Hamiltonian exhibiting chiral anomaly. We discuss the experimental feasibility and conclude that it is possible to realize this new exotic state using techniques such as THz metamaterial enhancement of magnetic fields.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12231v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|>1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moiré systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $κ$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $κ$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6figures.

The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.</p></details> |  |

Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase diagram is rich with Néel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between Néel and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models, although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold anisotropy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p></details> |  |

This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</p></details> | 53 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12746v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.</p></details> |  |

Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have proven itself as a surprisingly useful solution to perform this task over large distance with outstanding precision and reliability. Over the last decade, important milestones have been achieved bringing SAW-driven single-electron transport from first proof-of-principle demonstrations to accurate, highly-controlled implementations, such as coherent spin transport, charge-to-photon conversion, or antibunching of charge states. Beyond the well-established piezoelectric gallium-arsenide platform, first realisations of acousto-electronic transport have also been carried out on the surface of liquid helium that promises unique stability and coherence. In this review article, we aim to keep track of this remarkable progress in SAW-driven transport of electron qubits by explaining these recent achievements from basic principles, with an outlook on follow-up experiments and near-term applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competition of fermion pairing, magnetism, and charge order in the spin-doped attractive Hubbard gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10605v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Spin Liquids on the Tetratrillium Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10489v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.</p></details> | 33 pages, 22 figures |

Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</p></details> | <details><summary>6.5 p...</summary><p>6.5 pages main text + 9 pages supplementary materials, additional details on the method used and results for more general case</p></details> |

In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</p></details> | 64 pages, 31 figures |

The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+12...</summary><p>12+12 pages, 5+7 figures</p></details> |

Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</p></details> |  |

Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
