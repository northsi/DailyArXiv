| **[Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06781v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in Isolated Single Copper Oxygen Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06389v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the central questions in cuprate superconductivity is if superconductivity can exist in an isolated single CuO$_2$ plane without any interlayer coupling. There have been numerous experimental efforts to answer this question, but it still has not been clearly resolved. Here we present a heterostructure system with an isolated half-unit-cell La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ which has a single CuO$_2$ plane. Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06312v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures,Accepted in J.

| **[Magnon-Mediated Superconductivity in the Infinite-$U$ Triangular Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06231v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moiré Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures (including Supplementary Material).Submitted to Physical Review Letters</p></details> |
| **[Electronic Structure and Superconducting Gap of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05624v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatially-resolved laser-based high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have been performed on the optimally-doped HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$ (Hg1223) superconductor with a $T_c$ at 133 K. Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Higher-Order Topological Superconductivity and Electrically Tunable Majorana Corner Modes in Monolayer MnXPb$_2$ (X=Se, Te)-Pb Heterostructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05505v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes localized at corners or hinges, providing a promising route toward scalable and controllable Majorana networks without vortices or magnetic flux. Here we propose a symmetry-enforced higher-order topological superconductivity based on antiferromagnetic topological insulators, specifically realized in MnXPb$_2$ (X = Se, Te)-Pb heterostructure. We show that the intrinsic boundary dichotomy-gapless Dirac states protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry on antiferromagnetic edges and magnetic gaps on ferromagnetic edges-naturally generates Majorana corner modes as mass domain walls. Superconducting proximity converts the antiferromagnetic edges into one-dimensional topological superconductors, and the intersections between superconducting and magnetic edges bind Majorana zero modes as mass domain walls. Combining first-principles calculations with a calibrated effective boundary theory, we demonstrate robust corner localization and purely electrical control of Majorana fusion and braiding in a triangular geometry. Our results establish MnXPb$_2$ as experimentally promising platform for electrically programmable Majorana networks in two dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00452v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can superconducting order be engineered as a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated systems? We demonstrate this possibility by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle-hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, specifically a locally transformed $η$-pair lowering operator, on a single lattice site only, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) exhibiting macroscopic $η$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization stands in stark contrast to schemes reliant on spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a single local dissipative seed suffices to establish long-range coherence across the entire interacting lattice system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism via three core features: local dark-state selection, the controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we systematically classify the stability of this NESS with respect to static disorder, and identify a wide regime in which the superconducting attractor remains robust against Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve the effective subspace structure. We also pinpoint specific perturbations that directly cause dephasing of the $% η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. These findings open up a disorder-tolerant pathway for stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor through minimal local quantum-jump control.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

| **[3D Spin-orbital liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06628v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-orbital liquids provide an exactly solvable route to three-dimensional Z2 quantum spin liquids beyond the original Kitaev setting. Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ab initio spin Hamiltonians and magnetism of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03177v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We calculate the crystal-field splitting, ground-state Kramers doublet and intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version. 9 pages, 3 figures + 13 pages of Supplementary</p></details> |
| **[Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02256v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many-body entanglement properties of quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate both the {\em stability} and {\em spatial distribution} of entanglement for the Kitaev model of QSL, which is made {\em open} by its sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and then time-evolved in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. From the time-dependent density matrix of QSL subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and the expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: ({\em i}) in the Markovian regime, it remains nonzero only in hexagonal loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs), eventually vanishing on the same timescale on which the EV of the Wilson loop operator vanishes; ({\em ii}) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, surprisingly, GMN remains nonzero up to much higher temperatures while also remaining zero in non-loopy subregions. In addition, the non-Markovian dynamics generates emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via engineering of dissipation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 119 references, Supplemental Material with additional figures and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
| **[Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nonlinear light cone spreading of correlations in a triangular quantum magnet: a hard quantum simulation target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02433v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures. 11 pages supplemental information</p></details> |
| **[Anisotropic Kitaev Spin Glass in Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22280v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $β$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures Corrected minor typos in manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Topological $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid on the honeycomb lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06549v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice and resolve the long-standing question of its ground state in an unbiased and quantitatively controlled manner. We find compelling numerical evidence that the ground state is a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid, characterized by a finite topological entanglement entropy close to $\ln(4)$, the absence of both $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ and lattice symmetry breaking, and a variationally optimized ground-state energy well below competing Dirac spin liquid states. By exploiting full $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ symmetry and keeping up to 12,800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ multiplets, corresponding to more than one million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states, we achieve unprecedented accuracy for two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ quantum magnets. Finite-size scaling of energies and entanglement entropies supports a robust gapped phase in the two-dimensional limit, while a gapless critical state on narrow cylinders is identified as a proximate remnant of a Dirac spin-orbital liquid. Our results establish the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ honeycomb Heisenberg model as a concrete realization of a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid and provide robust numerical evidence for topological order in a highly symmetric two-dimensional quantum magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 + 2...</summary><p>5 + 2 pages, 4 + 1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spiral Phase and Phase Diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ Model on the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22924v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ model on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice using exact diagonalization (ED), density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) with DMRG as a solver. In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[N-state Potts ices as generalizations of classical and quantum spin ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22909v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical and quantum spin ice models are amongst the most popular settings for the study of spin liquid physics. $N-$state Potts ice models have been constructed that generalize spin ice, hosting multiple emergent $\text{U}(1)$ gauge fields and excitations charged under non-trivial combinations of these fields. We present a general treatment of classical $N-$state Potts ices relating their properties to the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Lie algebras, and demonstrate how the properties of charged excitations in the classical model can be related to this symmetry group. We also introduce quantum generalizations of the Potts Ice models, and demonstrate how charge flavor changing interactions unique to $N>2$ models dominate their low energy physics. We further show how symmetries inherited from the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ can lead to flux vacuum frustration, greatly modifying the dynamical properties of charged excitations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $η$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $η$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $λ$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |

To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, APL Materials 14, 011114 (2026)</p></details> |

As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p></details> |  |

However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05889v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entanglement entropy and disorder operator at kagome deconfined quantum criticality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13774v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) candidate in the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, employing quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study the entanglement entropy and the $U(1)$ disorder operator. In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Non-Hermitian Second-Order Topological Phases and Bipolar Skin Effect in Photonic Kagome Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12760v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures.
