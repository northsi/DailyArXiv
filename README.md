| **[Statistics of the vortex pinning potential in superconducting films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11780v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the statistical properties of the vortex pinning potential in a thin superconducting film. Modeling intrinsic inhomogeneities by a random-temperature Ginzburg-Landau functional with short-range Gaussian disorder, we derive the pinning landscape $E(\mathbf{R})$ by determining how the vortex core adapts to randomness. Within the hard-core approximation, applicable for weak disorder, the energy landscape exhibits Gaussian statistics. In this regime, the mean areal density of its minima is given by $n_\text{min}\approx(6ξ)^{-2}$, indicating that the typical spacing between neighboring minima is significantly larger than the vortex core size $ξ$. Going beyond the hard-core approximation, we allow the vortex order parameter to relax in response to the inhomogeneities. As a result, the pinning potential statistics become non-Gaussian. We calculate the leading correction due to the core deformation, which reduces the density of minima with a relative magnitude scaling as $(T_c-T)^{-1/2}$.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[High magnetic field response of superconductivity dome in quantum artificial High Tc superlattices with variable geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11494v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that cuprate artificial high temperature superlattices (AHTS) with period d, composed of quantum wells confining interface space charge in stoichiometric Mott insulator layers (S), with thickness L, at the interface with overdoped normal metallic cuprate layers (N) show a superconducting dome by tuning the geometric L over d ratio of the SNSN superlattice with the top predicted by quantum material design engineering quantum size effects. Here we report high-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla of AHTS across the entire superconducting dome. The results show the universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature dependent upper critical magnetic field in low critical temperature samples at rising edge and drop edge of the dome providing compelling evidence for two-band superconductivity in agreement with multigap theory used for quantum design of the SNSN superlattices. The measured superconducting coherence length demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering controls not only the critical temperature but also the intrinsic pair size at Fano-Feshbach resonances physics paving the way toward next generation quantum devices and shedding light on unconventional superconductivity.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Enhanced Superconductivity in Proximity to Peaks in Densities of States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11451v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the BCS theory of superconductivity, the electron-phonon interaction is transformed to an attractive electron-electron interaction in the vicinity of the Fermi energy only. At the same time, its formal derivation using a unitary transformation reveals that the electrons attract one another whenever their energies do not differ more than the phonon energy $ω_\mathrm{D}$, independent of closeness to the Fermi energy. Consequently, the order parameter becomes finite even away from the Fermi level. Yet, for small interactions, its magnitude is usually small and can be safely ignored, justifying the BCS approximation. Intriguingly, we find that an accumulation of density-of-states at an energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$ in proximity to the Fermi energy induces a significant order parameter magnitude around $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$, which exceeds the one at $E_\mathrm{F}$ for moderate coupling strengths. This strong enhancement is heralded by the softening of an additional collective mode, which resembles a second phase transition. We predict measurable signatures in the thermodynamic and spectroscopic response of this unexpected phenomenon, guiding future experimental searches for it.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 processed by the high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11343v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A series of Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 samples, CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 with x values of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05, are synthesized using two distinct routes: conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. Comprehensive characterizations are performed on these samples to investigate their superconducting properties. This study examines the effects of Mn substitution at Fe sites in the FeAs layer on the superconducting properties of the CaKFe4As4 (1144) material. The HP-HTS process improves the microstructure and phase purity of the parent sample (x = 0), resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In contrast, Mn doping via the CSP method in CaKFe4As4 reduces the sample quality and superconducting performance. Notably, the high-pressure synthesis method leads to an increase in the Tc by 3 to 7 K, particularly at low Mn concentrations. While the critical current density (Jc) of the parent sample (x = 0) shows a significant enhancement under the applied magnetic fields, Jc decreases for Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 bulks. These results demonstrate that high-pressure synthesis is an effective approach to improve the superconducting properties of Mn-doped 1144 compounds.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fibonacci sequence of twist angles in superconducting multi-layer graphene and hydrogenated graphitic fibers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11248v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A range of twist angles between adjacent surfaces/volumes are intrinsic to natural graphite or artificially design in multi-layer graphene. In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence. Moreover, SC hydrogenated graphite can harbour higher-order topology as reflected in at least quadratic energy gap flattening. Charge transport and magnetization measurements on hydrogenated graphitic fibers have been done using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, to be published in IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Interplay between charge correlations and superconductivity across the superconducting domes of CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11177v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Geometric Control of Pairing: Universal Scaling of Superconductivity at KTaO3 Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10301v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting transition temperature Tc at KTaO3-based oxide interfaces exhibits a dramatic dependence on crystallographic orientation, yet a unifying principle has remained elusive. Here, we discover a universal linear scaling between Tc and a single geometric parameter - the angle θ between the (hkl) plane and the (100) plane - across ten different orientations of LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces. With the exception of (100), all orientations exhibit two dimensional superconductivity, with transition temperatures Tc ranging from ~ 0.12 K to 1.9 K. This linear θ-Tc scaling is robust against variations in growth temperature, device geometry, and transport configuration. By establishing geometric orientation as a direct control knob for pairing strength, our results impose a critical benchmark for microscopic theories of superconductivity in KTaO3-based systems.</p></details> | 4 figures |

| **[2$k_F$ instability and chiral spin density wave at the 1/9 magnetization plateau in the kagome antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11670v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17144v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 14 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary Material: 12 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18250v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+9 ...</summary><p>10+9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12298v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 16 pages supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16935v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $KΓΓ'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spin excitation continuum to topological magnon crossover and thermal Hall conductivity in Kitaev magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02516v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $α$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Optimizing the dynamical preparation of quantum spin lakes on the ruby lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09040v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids are elusive long-range entangled states. Motivated by experiments in Rydberg quantum simulators, recent excitement has centered on the possibility of dynamically preparing a state with quantum spin liquid correlation even when the ground state phase diagram does not exhibit such a topological phase. Understanding the microscopic nature of such quantum spin "lake" states and their relationship to equilibrium spin liquid order remains an essential question. Here, we extend the use of approximately symmetric neural quantum states for real-time evolution and directly simulate the dynamical preparation in systems of up to $N=384$ atoms. We analyze a variety of spin liquid diagnostics as a function of the preparation protocol and optimize the extent of the quantum spin lake thus obtained. In the optimal case, the prepared state shows spin-liquid properties extending over half the system size, with a topological entanglement entropy plateauing close to $γ= \ln 2$. We extract two physical length scales $λ$ and $ξ$ which constrain the extent of the quantum spin lake $\ell$ from above and below.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

We map out the phase diagram using three complementary approaches, including self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo. This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 1...</summary><p>6 + 11 pages, 3 + 2 figures</p></details> |

Using Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we uncover a rich variety of phases where the intra and interlayer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes (visons) are arranged in a periodic fashion in the ground state, tuned by interlayer coupling and out-of-plane external magnetic field. We further extend our model to moiré superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized arrangements of plaquette values that correlate with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moiré unit cell. Moreover, we find that, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moiré superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $π$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $π$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra.

| **[Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.</p></details> |  |

Our resistivity and heat capacity measurements indicate that YRu$_3$B$_2$ is a weakly coupled superconductor, with critical temperature $T_c$ = 0.63 K and upper critical field $μ_0 H_{c2}$ (0)=0.11 T. Density functional theory calculations, together with chemical-bonding analysis, reveal that the electronic states at and near the Fermi energy level are dominated by the Ru kagome sublattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static and dynamic properties of the frustrated spin-1/2 depleted-kagome antiferromagnet Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03546v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ depleted-kagome compound Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ are investigated using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

| **[Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Emergent Spin-Singlet Pairing in the Frustrated Kagome Metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02176v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures including supplementary information</p></details> |
