With independent control of carrier density and interlayer separation, the system exhibits a rich phase diagram, including exciton condensates, Wigner crystals, and for large hole-to-electron mass ratios, an electron-liquid hole-crystal phase. This mixed phase is an analog of two-dimensional metallic hydrogen, featuring an electron liquid immersed in and coupled to a lattice of heavy holes. We show that acoustic plasmons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons, leading to BCS-type superconductivity at experimentally accessible parameters. The superconducting transition temperature is calculated from first principles, and experimental realization in van der Waals heterostructures is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 + 7...</summary><p>7 + 7 pages, 4 + 7 figures</p></details> |

We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 3+2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Transverse superconducting diode without parity and time-reversal violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01560v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by its nonreciprocal nature in critical supercurrents. However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, with Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Van der Waals superconducting electronics: materials, devices and circuit integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07018v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Van der Waals (vdW) superconductors - atomically thin crystalline materials that can be stacked into more complex heterostructures - have opened a promising avenue for superconducting electronics thanks to their properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain in other superconducting materials. These include strong resilience to high in-plane fields, electrostatic tuneability, and non-reciprocal transport rooted in inversion-symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Impact of Ionic Anharmonicity on Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12068v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal-stuffed B$-$C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\text{c}$ values for KRb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\text{B}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06504v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films grown on SrF2(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm c}=1.72$ K. The field-induced broadening of the transition and the presence of finite upper critical fields are consistent with type-II superconductivity. We determine the resistively defined upper critical fields for magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the film plane and parameterize their temperature dependence using an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach. For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $ξ_{ab}\approx 55$ nm and $ξ_c\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\mathrm c}\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+3...</summary><p>4.5+3 pages, 2+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Role of Disorder in Governing the Magnetic Properties of Cu2IrO3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07379v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is a honeycomb iridate which has been studied recently as a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Its magnetic ground state however, has been reported to be quantum disordered, spin glassy, or magnetically ordered depending on synthesis details. We have prepared a Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ sample with large antisite disorder and studied in detail its structure (global and local), charge states, and thermodynamic properties to try to quantify and characterize the disorder and its connection to the magnetic ground state. X-ray diffraction, Extended x-ray absorption fine structure(EXAFS) and X-ray pair distribution function analysis revealed a large site disorder ($\sim$25\%), while XPS and XANES reveal mixed valence of Cu and Ir following Cu$^{1+}$ + Ir$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + Ir$^{3+}$. This combination of site disorder and charge redistribution generates competing antiferromagnetic interactions and magnetic frustration, resulting in dynamically fluctuating AFM clusters near 80K that freeze below 29K. These results demonstrate the crucial role of synthesis dependent disorder in determining the magnetic ground state of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$, which demonstrates a novel path to spiral spin-liquids by overcoming the long-standing impediment of weak further-neighbor interactions. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, improved analysis of the INS spectra</p></details> |
| **[Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298v4)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_τ V_s)$, where $N_τ$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_τV_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_τ\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+5 ...</summary><p>13+5 pages, 6+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the finite-doping sign problem is evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We compute quantum oscillations in the density of states, and predict signatures of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates, despite the absence of hole pockets in photoemission and STM. A regime with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order is needed, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order. We also note distinctive features of the theory in the electron spectral function above the Fermi energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures. v5 Added co-author and predictions for electronic spectrum above the Fermi energy</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25539v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Dominant Kitaev Interaction and Field-induced Quantum Disordered Phase in the Cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01957v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we propose an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spectroscopic Demarcation of Emergent Photons and Spinons in a Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03202v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$, the candidate $π$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $π$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs.</p></details> |  |

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05735v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $k=1$. (ii) ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $k=-2$ on the honeycomb faces and $k=1$ on the triangular faces. (iii) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $k=1$; and (iv) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $k=1$. As for ferromagnetic to different types of paramagnetic phase, besides the Ising universality class with $y_t=1$, varying critical exponents have also been found with different values of vertex weights. The transition between the third type and fourth type of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$. The third and fourth types of the vortex lattice phase to the vortex disorder phase are found to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. These findings contribute to the search for and understanding of ice on complex lattices.</p></details> | 16 pages, 19 figures |

The crystal structure was determined by using single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CrGe1-xSe3+y crystallizes with a space group R-3m, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms, sandwiched between disordered Ge-Se layers. This compound displays antiferromagnetic order below 50 K, unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in CrGeTe3. Chromium displays an effective moment of ~3.9 μB/Cr, consistent with Cr3+ oxidation. The presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic CrGeSe3 analogous to CrGeTe3.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $φ$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(θ= 90^{\circ}, φ)$. In contrast, for fixed $φ$, the transitions driven by varying $θ$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Triple-well ferroelectricity and kagome-like Chern flat band in two-dimensional multiferroic CuVP$_2$Se$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04846v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional multiferroics that host nontrivial topological bands offer a rich platform for correlated and tunable quantum phenomena, yet such materials remain rare. Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</p></details> |  |
