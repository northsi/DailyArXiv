| **[Superconductivity in Substitutional Ga-Hyperdoped Ge Epitaxial Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15421v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doping-induced superconductivity in group IV elements may enable quantum functionalities in material systems accessible with well-established semiconductor technologies. Non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into C, Si, or Ge can yield superconductivity; however, its origin is obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films and trilayer heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</p></details> |  |

Multicomponent superconductors, particularly ones breaking multiple symmetries, are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. Here we show that even, nominally $single$-component superconductors under certain conditions are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. We consider nearest-neighbor pairing interactions on a square lattice that leads to $s$-wave and $d$-wave representations of link superconducting order parameter. We show that even if the subdominant order parameter is completely suppressed in the ground state, it results in multiple correlation lengths with nontrivial hierarchy, resulting in important physical consequences in inhomogeneous solutions. Under certain conditions, this leads to type-1.5 superconductivity, where magnetic field penetration length falls between two coherence lengths, leading to vortex clustering in an external magnetic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures (Supplementary 11 pages, 4 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Optical Properties of Superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ Single Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11123v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optical properties of the superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals with a critical temperature $T_c\approx 26$ K have been measured in the {\it ab} plane in a wide frequency range using both infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV. An abrupt decrease in the low-frequency dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon _1(ω)$ at $T < T_c$ also evidences the formation of the superconducting condensate. The superconducting plasma frequency $ω_{pl,s} = (213\pm 5)$~cm$^{-1}$ and the magnetic penetration depth $λ=(7.5\pm 0.2)$~$μ$m at $T=5$~K are determined.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[The True Parent Phase of K1.9Fe4.2Se5: A Stripe-type Orthorhombic Phase Requiring a Superconducting Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10443v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 main figures.

| **[Raman fingerprint of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10784v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures has prompted great excitement, intense research, but also debate over the past decade. Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10364v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02405v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample batch.TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16788v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the future with magnons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06382v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each component following Suzuki--Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes--Suzuki--Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16240v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Nonreciprocal Spin-Glass Transition and Aging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17360v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disordered systems generically exhibit aging and a glass transition. Previous studies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness. Here, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical Sherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between two identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition from a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as non-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Evidence of de Almeida-Thouless line below six dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $θ= 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($σ_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Cluster percolation in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05748v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on extensive parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the relationship between cluster percolation and equilibrium ordering phenomena in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model as one varies the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. We consider a range of cluster definitions, most of which are constructed in the space of overlaps between two independent real replicas of the system. In the pure ferromagnet that is contained as a limiting case in the class of problems considered, the relevant percolation point coincides with the thermodynamic ordering transition. For the disordered ferromagnet encountered first on introducing antiferromagnetic bonds and the adjacent spin-glass phase of strong disorder this connection is altered, and one finds a percolation transition above the thermodynamic ordering point that is accompanied by the appearance of /two/ percolating clusters of equal density. Only at the lower (disordered) ferromagnetic or spin-glass transition points the densities of these two clusters start to diverge, thus providing a percolation signature of these thermodynamic transitions. We compare the scaling behavior at this secondary percolation transition with the thermodynamic behavior at the corresponding ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables, RevTeX 4.2</p></details> |

| **[Topological states and flat bands in exactly solvable decorated Cayley trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11261v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 24 figures + 8 pages of Supplemental Material</p></details> |
| **[Continuous transition and gapless roton inside fractional quantum anomalous Hall states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745v7)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective excitations play a vital role in understanding the exotic phases of matter and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems. For the first time, we numerically (via exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group) report the microscopic realization of a transition from a translationally invariant fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state to the same FQAH state with spontaneously broken translation symmetry, by softening the magnetoroton mode (intrinsic collective excitations in such systems) through isotropic interactions in a topological flat-band model. At the critical point, the gap of collective neutral excitations closes at finite momentum, while the charge gap remains robust. This mechanism echoes with the integer quantum Hall crystals and fractional quantum Hall nematics in Landau levels, but exhibits unique features. Further through criticality analysis, we identify that this non-trivial transition is consistent with the Ising universality class. Such spontaneous translation symmetry breaking inside the topological ordered FQAH state could serve as a generic scheme in various systems, with experimental implications to the quantum moiré materials and the cold-atom systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin Liquids on the Tetratrillium Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10489v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moiré bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31°. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moiré bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moiré bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moiré bulk systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 (7+3) figures, Final version; Accepted for publication in JPCM</p></details> |
| **[Magnetoelectric Switching of Magnetic Order in Rhombohedral Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24672v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic order. In rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, the angular momentum that breaks TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature at the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (R6G), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of R6G. Our findings present crystalline R6G as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insights into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion</p></details> |  |
| **[-Continuum limit of bipartite lattices -- The SSH model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11900v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p></details> |  |

MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{é} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have proven itself as a surprisingly useful solution to perform this task over large distance with outstanding precision and reliability. Over the last decade, important milestones have been achieved bringing SAW-driven single-electron transport from first proof-of-principle demonstrations to accurate, highly-controlled implementations, such as coherent spin transport, charge-to-photon conversion, or antibunching of charge states. Beyond the well-established piezoelectric gallium-arsenide platform, first realisations of acousto-electronic transport have also been carried out on the surface of liquid helium that promises unique stability and coherence. In this review article, we aim to keep track of this remarkable progress in SAW-driven transport of electron qubits by explaining these recent achievements from basic principles, with an outlook on follow-up experiments and near-term applications.</p></details> |  |

Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Spin Liquids on the Tetratrillium Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10489v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.</p></details> | 33 pages, 22 figures |

These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological order in symmetric blockade structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17123v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, v2: update to published version, minor fixes in appendices</p></details> |

We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $π$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Our experimental results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)]. Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below $T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Simulations are done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n $\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted apatite family.</p></details> |  |

They are highly promising for data manipulation and transfer at terahertz rates, much faster than in the case of ferromagnetic magnon-polaritons, which operate at GHz frequencies. Yet, control of terahertz magnon-polaritons by the voltage, i.e. without ohmic dissipation losses, remains challenging. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using an electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-Pérot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for electrical manipulation of the cavity's photonic environment by control of its dielectric constant. This adjustment, in turn, influences the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons, thereby controlling the vacuum Rabi oscillations of the magnon resonance coupled to a particular cavity mode. Our approach enables reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization that can be triggered without direct electrical contact or alteration of the magnetic medium. These findings pave the way for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and open new avenues for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.</p></details> |  |

These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+12...</summary><p>12+12 pages, 5+7 figures</p></details> |

Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden symmetry-breaking in a kagome Ising ferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07606v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena that emerge from their frustrated lattice geometry and associated band topology. Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Using the capping ligands for shape-controlled growth of colloidal crystals is challenging due to the size mismatch of molecules and nanoparticle building blocks. In existing synthetic pathways, colloidal crystal shapes are determined by their thermodynamically favored phases yet controlling their shapes independent of lattice symmetry is vital to study many solid-state properties. Here, we develop a nanoparticle capping strategy to control colloidal crystal shapes and structural heterogeneity. Au bipyramids were used as building blocks and assembled into rhombohedral colloidal crystals driven by DNA hybridization. In (111) planes of the crystals, bipyramids assembled into kagome lattices, featuring structure cavities organized in a hexagonal lattice. The rhombohedral crystals have truncated tetrahedral crystal habits, and the degree of truncation defines the exposed facets and crystal shapes. Our surface capping strategy is to introduce DNA-modified nanospheres as effective capping agents, which selectively register on the surface vacancies of the kagome facets and resemble the role of organic ligands in classic nanocrystal growth. Such selective capping is driven by maximizing DNA hybridization and leads to slower growth of the (111) kagome facets, changing the crystal shape from three-dimensional truncated tetrahedra to two-dimensional layered microplates with structural heterogeneity and shape anisotropy. This study underpins the importance of capping agents in colloidal crystal growth and inspires effective ways to control the growth kinetics and heterostructures of colloidal crystals.</p></details> |  |

Our transverse-field $μ$SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) $μ$SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF-$μ$SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Yet, 5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$ members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($γ=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic ground state across the material family.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Anisotropy of linear magnetoresistance in Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05023v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the quantized energy is $ε_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum, the energy is $ε_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR. Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.</p></details> |  |
