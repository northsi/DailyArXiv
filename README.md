| **[Spin-fluctuation-mediated chiral $d+id'$-wave superconductivity in the $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with an incipient flat band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14379v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study anisotropic superconductivity in the nearly quarter-filled $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We analyze an extended Hubbard model with off-site attractive interactions within the mean-field framework and find two distinct chiral $d+id'$-wave superconducting phases characterized by different Chern numbers. We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Muon Knight shift as a precise probe of the superconducting symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14107v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Muon spin rotation ($μ$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $μ$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $μ$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $μ$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Field-angle-resolved heat transport in UTe$_2$: determination of nodal positions in the superconducting order parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13877v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the recurring hurdles in studying unconventional superconductivity is the challenge of efficiently and conclusively identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in a new material. Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures (including SI)</p></details> |

Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(7+8 ...</summary><p>(7+8 pages, 4+5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13793v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13601v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 main figures, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13367v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Phase diagram of the Kitaev-Hubbard model: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin and QMC approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17089v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01513v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12570v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[2$k_F$ instability and chiral spin density wave at the 1/9 magnetization plateau in the kagome antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11670v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17144v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 14 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary Material: 12 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18250v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+9 ...</summary><p>10+9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 16 pages supplemental material</p></details> |

In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $π$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $π$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $φ$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(θ=90^{\circ},φ)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(θ,φ$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Bulk superconductivity in the kagome metal YRu3B2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09314v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials with a kagome sublattice have been heavily studied recently for their exotic electronic band structure, structural frustration, high-temperature charge order transitions, and unconventional electron-phonon coupling. In LaRu3Si2, it was proposed that electronic flat bands conspire with the characteristic phonon spectrum of the kagome lattice to drive enhanced superconductivity at Tc = 7 K. Here, we report bulk superconductivity in the structural analogue YRu3B2, which hosts a structurally pristine kagome lattice. We observe a superconducting transition at Tc = 0.7 K through magnetization, resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements in this novel kagome metal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.</p></details> |  |

Our resistivity and heat capacity measurements indicate that YRu$_3$B$_2$ is a weakly coupled superconductor, with critical temperature $T_c$ = 0.63 K and upper critical field $μ_0 H_{c2}$ (0)=0.11 T. Density functional theory calculations, together with chemical-bonding analysis, reveal that the electronic states at and near the Fermi energy level are dominated by the Ru kagome sublattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static and dynamic properties of the frustrated spin-1/2 depleted-kagome antiferromagnet Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03546v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ depleted-kagome compound Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ are investigated using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.
