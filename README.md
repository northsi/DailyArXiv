| **[Proximity effect in asymmetric-gap superconducting bilayers and regularization of transition rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17765v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*).</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages + Supplemental Material, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Bulk signatures of re-entrant superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from ultrasound measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17691v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report bulk ultrasound measurements up to 80 T and down to 0.5 K of the field re-entrant superconducting phase of the unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$. Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |
| **[Hybridization of lattice and charge order excitations in a superconducting cuprate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20503v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquitous tendency of superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves (CDWs) has reignited interest in the nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their phase diagrams. While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: 2...</summary><p>v3: 25 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables.

| **[Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18951v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |

The initial-slope method enabled detection of the electronic specific heat down to 60~mK, revealing a fully gapped state with $Δ(0)/k_{\rm B} = 1.43$~K. Both the gap magnitude and specific-heat jump are smaller than BCS predictions, while quasiparticle excitations are strongly suppressed, consistent with a theoretical expectation for aperiodic systems. AC-susceptibility measurements show a large upper critical field and pronounced anisotropy, reflecting the quasi-two-dimensional structure. These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence for a full-gap superconducting state in a quasicrystal and highlight unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond periodic lattices.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Chiral topological superconductivity in twisted bilayer and double bilayer graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17380v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 13 PDF Figures, Comments are welcome</p></details> |

| **[Microscopic evidence of a field-induced critical spin-liquid state in a frustrated metal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20204v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$μ$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $μ$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($λ_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

The ability to control exchange-coupling within these systems is therefore highly desirable. Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons. This mechanical control of Kondo coupling could be extended to other forms of interlayer exchange coupling, potentially allowing for atomic-scale design or control of spintronics technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, and SI 3 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Power-Law Suppression of Phonon Thermal Transport by Magnetic Excitations in a Molecular Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16137v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T < 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recent progress in quantum spin liquids, fractional magnetization plateaus, and unconventional superconductivity in kagome lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16131v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice, with its unique geometric structure, has emerged as a leading platform for exploring quantum many-body physics, particularly in the study of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) and unconventional superconductivity. This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.</p></details> | published |

In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Phase diagram of the Kitaev-Hubbard model: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin and QMC approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17089v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01513v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages main text, 41 total including supplementary info, 4 main figures, 40 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/Å. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</p></details> |  |

Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages main text (15 pages in total), 4 main text figures (9 figures total)</p></details> |

We report a comprehensive first-principles study of Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ kagome bilayers, examining four stacking configurations (AA, AA$'$, AB, AB$'$). Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics. Carrier effective masses show significant stacking dependence, ranging from 2.39-6.35~$m_0$ for electrons and 0.67-1.55~$m_0$ for holes. Strain engineering of the AB$'$ bilayer demonstrates non-monotonic band gap tuning and asymmetric modulation of carrier masses, with hole effective masses showing stronger strain sensitivity. These results establish Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform for strain-engineered kagome-based quantum devices, where stacking order and mechanical deformation provide complementary control over electronic transport.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Kondo Effect in Strained Kagome Nanoribbons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17030v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metallic kagome systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years, as they provide a rich platform for studying phenomena associated with their distinctive band structure. The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wiedemann-Franz violation and thermal Hall effect in kagome metal TbCr6Ge6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16868v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = κ_{xx,xy} / (T σ_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.</p></details> |  |

Using microscopic modeling and symmetry analysis, we show that Josephson junctions formed by conventional $s$-wave superconductors (SCs) and cAFMs on the kagome lattice exhibit Josephson diode effects and anomalous phase shifts ($φ_0$-junction state) when space inversion $\mathcal{I}$, time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$, and combined mirror-time-reversal $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetries are simultaneously broken. We propose two setups to realize these phenomena and achieve high diode efficiency. (i) An SC/cAFM/SC junction with spin-orbit coupling, which enables a field-free diode effect with a robust tunable $φ_0$-junction state. (ii) An SC/cAFM/cAFM$^\prime$/SC junction, where two cAFM layers with different in-plane order orientations, under an out-of-plane Zeeman exchange field, produces significant diode effect and anomalous phase shifts. These results establish a direct link between $\mathcal{TM}_z$ symmetry breaking and nonreciprocal superconductivity, suggesting cAFMs as versatile platforms for symmetry-engineered Josephson diodes and tunable $φ_0$-junctions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.</p></details> | published |
| **[Kagome Topology in Two-Dimensional Noble-Metal Monolayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14850v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
