| **[Mitigation of Magnetic Flux Trapping in Superconducting Electronics Using Moats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18345v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic flux (vortex) trapping remains a major obstacle to very large scale integration in superconducting electronics. Moats -- etched regions in circuit layers placed in ground planes and around critical circuitry -- offer a simple passive approach to sequester flux. Here, we systematically examine the effectiveness of moat arrays in superconducting niobium films as a function of geometry (size, shape, and density) and background magnetic field. By measuring the vortex expulsion field, we estimate the flux saturation number and flux trapping temperature for a range of geometries. We find that many moat designs effectively sequester flux in magnetically shielded environments (< 1 $μ$T), with high-aspect-ratio rectangular "slit" moats providing the strongest mitigation at minimal area cost. However, our measurements show that moats alone do not eliminate flux trapping in non-ideal films, as vortices can preferentially pin at material defects. These results provide design guidance for flux mitigation in superconducting integrated circuits and highlight the need for combined optimization of circuit geometries and materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, 59 references</p></details> |
| **[Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08201v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

| **[Extended Mean-Field Theory for the 2D Hubbard Model in Degenerate Dilute Electron Gases: Fluctuations, Superconducting Dome, and Interaction Mechanisms in Strontium Titanate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17996v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3, STO}$) dome-shaped superconducting transition temperature as a function of chemical potential, consistent with STO experiments, and shows that tunable s-wave and d-wave symmetries are modulated by doping. Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semiclassical theory for the orbital magnetic moment of superconducting quasiparticles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17376v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Near-single-domain superconducting aluminum films on GaAs(111)A with exceptional crystalline quality for scalable quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17249v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $θ$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $Σ$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[High-temperature $η$-pairing superconductivity in the photodoped Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17238v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $η$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15998v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17000v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $α$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\llξ_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\ggξ_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $α_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</p></details> |  |

Here, motivated by NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, we use numerical simulation to explore the phases which arise in a minimal model of a spin-1 pyrochlore magnet, once quadrupole moments are taken into account. We identify seven distinct Coulombic spin liquid phases, including one with nematic correlations. Through quantitative comparison with inelastic neutron scattering, we show that this nematic spin liquid provides a compelling scenario for both the spin liquid observed in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, and its spin glass transition, without the need to invoke disorder. These results highlight the great wealth of unconventional phases which arise for magnetic ions capable of supporting both dipole and quadrupole moments.</p></details> | 62 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15020v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5+9...</summary><p>5+5+9 pages, 3+3+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14769v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13192v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 8...</summary><p>8 + 8 pages, 3 + 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12990v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 36 figures.

When two systems with independent disorders are coupled, their overlaps become similar. A crucial question is how this effect depends on the strength of the coupling between the two systems. Non-perturbative phenomena are present when $1 \ll ΔH \ll N$, being $ΔH$ the coupling Hamiltonian and $N$ the size of the system. In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to PNAS</p></details> |

The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16665v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Motivated by replica methods in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce replica Markov processes, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of the dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions. Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the Rényi and Tsallis entropies, where the bounds involve the initial dynamical activity. Analogous bounds can be derived for the entropies of the state distribution. In particular, we provide upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy of state distributions. Moreover, we show that the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the state distribution are bounded from above by terms involving the local escape rate from the initial node. We also illustrate how replicas can be used to study other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12595v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages.
