| **[Superconductivity, Kondo physics and magnetic order: Tuning the groundstate in the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution through the interplay between $3d$ and $4f$ correlated electrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04097v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a study of the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution ($0 \leq x \leq 1$), a family of intermetallic hydrides of ZrCuSiAs-type structure, with space group $P4/nmm$. For low cerium concentrations $x \leq 0.20$, we observe the presence of superconductivity, which originates from the correlated $3d$ electrons of iron. The superconducting regime is progressively suppressed by the cerium substitution. For moderate cerium concentration $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.50$, we observe evidence of the single-ion Kondo effect and no magnetic phase transition down to 2 K. For $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, the single-ion Kondo effect coexists with a superconducting ground state at low temperatures. From $x > 0.50$, we observe signatures of Kondo coherence and a heavy Fermi liquid regime at low temperature. Finally, at high cerium concentration $x \geq 0.85$, we observe signatures of magnetic ordering at low temperatures. We discuss our results by introducing temperature scales related to superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, which permits building a rich phase diagram temperature versus cerium content $x$. This shows that using the cerium concentration $x$ as a unique control parameter, we can explore the Kondo entanglement between correlated $3d$ and $4f$ electrons, which suggests an unusual change between the superconducting state related to the $3d$ electrons and the Kondo coherent state involving both $3d$ and $4f$ electrons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic second-harmonic generation in superconducting nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03989v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuits based on superconducting nanostructures are among the most promising platforms for quantum computing. Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are relevant for superconducting devices that require controllable high-frequency nonlinearity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + Supporting Information</p></details> |
| **[In-plane ferromagnetism-driven topological nodal-point superconductivity with tilted Weyl cones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03929v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential application of topological superconductivity in quantum transport and quantum information has fueled an intense investigation of hybrid materials with emergent electronic properties, including magnet-superconductor heterostructures. Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03922v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in Electron Liquids: Precision Many-Body Treatment of Coulomb Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19382v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic Field-Enhanced Graphene Superconductivity with Record Pauli-Limit Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10873v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Altermagnetic Superconducting Diode Effect in Mn$_{3}$Pt/Nb Heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03366v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages and three figures</p></details> |
| **[Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect from non-collinear compensated magnetism in Mn$_3$Pt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03348v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extreme Anisotropy in the Metallic and Superconducting Phases of Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129v4)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In strongly correlated electronic systems, Coulomb interactions frequently manifest through emergent electronic orders that spontaneously break rotational symmetry. Understanding how such symmetry breaking intertwines with other collective phenomena -- such as unconventional superconductivity -- and how it shapes experimental observables, particularly transport responses, remains a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report a metallic phase with extreme transport anisotropy in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, with an anisotropy ratio rivaling that of quantum Hall stripe phases. At low temperature, a superconducting state emerges from this metallic phase. Strikingly, the superconductor not only inherits strong anisotropy but also exhibits a wide range of hysteretic transitions arising from the tunability of the underlying anisotropic order. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized coexistence between superconductivity and extreme transport anisotropy, shedding new light on the role of rotational symmetry breaking in shaping unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with method section and SI, 4 figures in main text</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Electron-Phonon Coupling and Superconductivity in Ba-Alloyed A15 LaH5.75](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02966v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have established rare earth A15 type hydrides as a distinct family of high temperature superconductors that can be stabilized at significantly lower pressures compared to other superconducting hydrides. In particular, A15 type LaH5.75 was recently shown to be a high Tc superconductor. We have investigated a range of ternary substitutions and demonstrate that partial substitution of La by Ba stabilizes the A15 hydride lattice, with La0.75Ba0.25H5.75 identified as a stable compound. We calculate a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 183 K, almost double that of LaH5.75 at similar pressures. Ba typically acts as a 2 plus ion, while La is 3 plus. The reduced electron count disrupts the formation of H2 units and shifts the Fermi surface, leading to strongly enhanced electron phonon coupling. By contrast, substitution with Hf fails to produce any stable compounds. This work extends emerging alloy design principles in A15 hydride superconductors, demonstrating that doping can shift the Fermi level and tune the strength of the electron phonon coupling. These results provide concrete guidance for the experimental realization of new high Tc phases.</p></details> | 7 figures, 17 pages |

| **[Dominant Kitaev Interaction and Field-induced Quantum Disordered Phase in the Cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01957v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we propose an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spectroscopic Demarcation of Emergent Photons and Spinons in a Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03202v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$, the candidate $π$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $π$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 32 figures.

| **[Spin-orbit coupling controlled two-dimensional magnetism in chromium trihalides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16709v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $λ_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. Finding direct evidence for Kitaev interaction and determining its value has been an essential but formidable challenge in Kitaev physics. Here we report the direct Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal symmetric $Γ$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. $K$ and $Γ$ exhibit dominant dependencies on $λ_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides a foundation for designing 2D magnetic materials exhibiting novel behaviors by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Instabilities of the Fractionalized Dirac Semimetal in the Kitaev-Kondo Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02110v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquid phases in Kitaev Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10226v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response for realistic Kitaev materials under strong magnetic fields and described by the generalized Kitaev $J$-$K$-$Γ$-$Γ'$ model. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on using more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe experimental observations well, and hence should be the candidate state realized in the Kitaev material, $α$-RuCl$_3$. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show that the polar-angle dependence of the fermionic gap can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample thickness dependence of structural and magnetic properties in $α$-RuCl$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00210v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The layered transition metal trihalide $α$-RuCl$_3$ has been studied extensively in recent years as a promising candidate for a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. In high quality samples, a complete structural transition from room-temperature C2/m to low-temperature R$\bar{3}$ is consistently observed, with a single magnetic transition to antiferromagnetic ordering at $\sim$7K. However, magnetic and physical properties have been shown to depend heavily on both sample size and sample quality, with small and damaged samples exhibiting incomplete structural transitions and multiple magnetic anomalies. Although large high quality samples have been well studied, an understanding of the features attributed to low quality or small sample size is limited. Here, we probe the structural and magnetic transitions of $α$-RuCl$_3$ single crystal samples via magnetic susceptibility through a range of thickness, manipulated through careful mechanical exfoliation. We present a non-destructive protocol for exfoliating crystals and show success to 30 $μ$m, where sample quality is observed to improve with successive cleaving. Higher temperature magnetic features at 10 K/12 K are found to emerge through cleaving, both with and without induced sample damage. In both cases, we link these additional magnetic features to a persistence of C2/m structure to the low-temperature regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exactly Solvable Models Hosting Altermagnetic Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24076v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct spin-$3/2$ and spin-$7/2$ models on the square-octagon and checkerboard lattices that are exactly solvable with Majorana representations. They give rise to spin-liquid phases with full spin-rotation and lattice-translational symmetries but broken time-reversal symmetry. Although non-zero on elementary plaquettes, the net orbital magnetic moment is guaranteed to vanish as a result of point symmetries; due to the analogy to long-range ordered altermagnets, these types of phases were dubbed altermagnetic spin liquids in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023152 (2025)]. For the spin-$3/2$ model, we find that a $g$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid emerges as the unique ground state. In contrast, the spin-7/2 model exhibits a significantly richer phase diagram, involving different types of chiral spin liquids competing with a $d$-wave altermagnetic spin liquid. Finally, we identify and characterize the topological and non-topological excitations, illustrating the rich physics of altermagnetic spin liquids resulting from the interplay of non-trivial topological and symmetry aspects of this novel phase of matter.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+7 p...</summary><p>8+7 pages, 3+5 figures</p></details> |

However, understanding their origin and properties remains a significant challenge due to competing and often long-range interactions mediated by conduction electrons. Here, by combining neutron scattering experiments with theoretical modeling via unprecedented multi-target fits that further incorporate the ferromagnentic resonance data and magnetization curve, we construct a realistic microscopic model for the prototypical intermetallic skyrmion host \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$. Beyond magnetic frustration, we identify the competition between dipolar interactions and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy as a key ingredient for stabilizing the rich chiral magnetic phases observed in this compound -- including a hexagonal skyrmion crystal and two distinct meron crystals. Remarkably, the meron crystal in lower field is revealed to be commensurate with the underlying lattice, and its unique three-meron-one-antimeron spin texture is verified by the polarized x-ray diffraction data. At elevated temperatures, the short-range spin correlations in \text{Gd}$_3$\text{Ru}$_4$\text{Al}$_{12}$ are well described by a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid. Perturbations from staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions give rise to chiral fluctuations that account for the temperature and field dependence of the anomalous Hall response. Our results highlight the unique power of neutron scattering, especially when combined with complementary experimental techniques, to unravel complex magnetic phase transitions and provide new insights into the rich variety of topological spin textures in frustrated systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 24 figures |

In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuneable skyrmion and anti-skyrmion fluids via mechanical strain in chiral kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00982v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00540v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconducting State and Collective Modes in Kagome Superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24831v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We comprehensively study the unconventional pairing and collective modes in the multiband kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=$\mathrm{K},\mathrm{Cs},\mathrm{Rb}$). By solving gap equations at zero temperature, we identify a transition from normal $s++/s\pm$-wave pairing to time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking pairing with a variation of inter-pocket interactions or density of states. This TRS breaking pairing originates from the superconducting phase frustration of different Fermi pockets and can account for experimental TRS breaking signal in kagome superconductors. Moreover, we investigate collective modes, including the Higgs, Leggett, and Bogoloubov-Anderson-Goldstone modes, arising from fluctuations of the amplitude, relative phase, and overall phase of the superconducting order parameters, respectively. Remarkably, due to the presence of multibands, one branch of the Leggett modes becomes nearly massless near the TRS breaking transition, providing a compelling smoking-gun signature of TRS-breaking superconductivity, in clear contrast to TRS-breaking charge orders. Our results elucidate the rich superconducting physics and its associated collective modes in kagome metals, and suggest feasible experimental detection of TRS breaking pairing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tunable Electronic Correlations in 135-Kagome Metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22576v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals exhibit rich correlated-electron physics, yet a systematic understanding of the degree of correlation across transition-metal species remains elusive. Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Effect of superconductivity by Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22430v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Evidence of Mott Insulator with Thermally Induced Melting Behavior in Kagome Compound Nb3Cl8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08730v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4figures |

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |
