| **[Anomalous metallic phase and reduced critical current in superconducting nanowires due to inverse proximity effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02828v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductor-to-metal transitions (SMTs) are key probes of mesoscopic superconductivity, but their interpretation can be complicated by device geometry and measurement conditions. Here, we study epitaxial InAs-Al nanowires and show that metallic contacts induce an inverse proximity effect (IPE), creating weak spots in the superconductor that strongly suppress the critical current and give rise to an anomalous metallic phase. Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties. Our findings reveal an overlooked observer effect in mesoscopic superconductors and provide essential guidance for interpreting SMTs and for designing devices based on these systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic and Tunable Superconducting Diode Effect in Quantum Spin Hall Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02575v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonreciprocal dissipationless transport has long been sought for applications in superconducting technologies. Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article: 16 pages, 5 figures.

| **[High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity near an Ising nematic quantum critical point in two dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08270v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near a two-dimensional Ising-type nematic quantum critical point, the quantum fluctuations of the nematic order parameter are coupled to the electrons, leading to non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between these two effects has been extensively studied through the Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap. However, previous studies often rely on various approximations that may introduce uncertainties in the results. Here, we re-visit the issue of how the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ is affected by removing certain common approximations. We numerically solve the self-consistent Dyson-Schwinger equations of the electron propagator $G(p)$, the nematic propagator $D(q)$, and the vertex function $Γ_{\mathrm{v}}^{\mathrm{1L}}(p+q,p)$ expanded up to the triangle order, without introducing further approximations. Our calculations reveal that the extended $s$-wave superconducting gap is the only convergent solution to the nonlinear gap equations. We investigate the evolution of $T_{c}$ as the system approaches the nematic quantum critical point from the disordered (tetragonal) phase. Under the bare vertex approximation, $T_{c}$ is monotonically enhanced. However, when vertex corrections are incorporated, $T_{c}$ initially increases but then decreases, with the maximum value of $T_{c}$ occurring at a point away from the quantum critical point. The obtained gap symmetry and the non-monotonic behavior of $T_{c}$ are compared with recent experiments on doped FeSe materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Unconventional superconductivity from crystal field fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02330v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy in superconducting phases coexisting with pair-, charge- and spin-density-waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02191v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the recent observations of spatial oscillations in the energy position of the superconducting coherence peaks in the cuprate, transition metal dichalcogenide, iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors are consistent with the possible presence of a pair-, charge- or spin-density-wave phase. We show that for all three cases, the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter, $Δ({\bf r})$ can be imaged via the critical Josephson current, $I_c({\bf r})$ measured in Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. Finally, we show that the spatial oscillations of the density waves and of $Δ({\bf r})$ exhibit relative phase shifts of $Δφ= 0$ or $π$ for a charge-density wave, and $Δφ=π/2$ for the spin-density wave.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01910v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distinct Modulation Behavior of Superconducting Coherence Peaks Associated with Sign-Reversal Gaps in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01703v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal two distinct types of superconducting (SC) gap modulations in bulk superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. By analyzing the phase relation between modulations at positive and negative bias, we identify in-phase (particle-hole asymmetric) and anti-phase (particle-hole symmetric) oscillations, corresponding to sign-reversing and sign-preserving scattering processes, respectively. The observed features are consistent with predictions from pair-breaking scattering interference (PBSI) theory and are distinguishable from other alternative mechanisms such as pair density waves. Our results provide compelling evidence that PBSI is the dominant mechanism behind the SC gap modulations in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, offering new insights into the role of impurity scattering in iron-based superconductors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Proximity effect and p-wave superconductivity in s-wave superconductor/helimagnet heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05479v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.</p></details> |  |

Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Emergent Spin-Singlet Pairing in the Frustrated Kagome Metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02176v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures including supplementary information</p></details> |
| **[$J_1-J_2$ Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02150v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power-Law Spectra and Asymptotic $ω/T$ Scaling in the Orbital-Selective Mott Phase of a Three-Orbital Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23758v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $ω/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[A resonant valence bond spin liquid in the dilute limit of doped frustrated Mott insulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ideas about resonant valence bond liquids and spin-charge separation have led to key concepts in physics such as quantum spin liquids, emergent gauge symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of a resonant valence bond phase in the Hubbard model that originally motivated the concept, a definitive realisation has yet to be achieved. Here we present a solution to this long-standing problem by uncovering a resonant valence bond phase exhibiting spin-charge separation in realistic Hamiltonians. We show analytically that this ground state emerges in the dilute-doping limit of a half-filled Mott insulator on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping, in the absence of exchange interactions. We confirm numerically that the results extend to finite exchange interactions, finite-sized systems and finite dopant density. Although much attention has been devoted to the emergence of unconventional states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be essential for stabilising robust, topologically ordered states in real materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[The algebraic spin liquid in the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09713v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) as a candidate for the ground state of the Mott insulating phase of fermions with six flavors on the Kagome lattice, particularly focusing on realizations using $^{173}$Yb atoms in optical lattices. Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) has the lowest variational energy among SU(6) symmetry-preserving trial wave functions with a periodicity of a 12-site unit cell, as well as uniform chiral states with larger unit cells. It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.</p></details> | 32 pages, 24 figures |

In this work, we investigate the impact of synthesis under a magnetic field (magnetosynthesis) on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of several Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) based materials with antiferromagnetic interactions and varying levels of magnetic frustration, from simple antiferromagnets to a quantum spin liquid. We employ small (0.09 - 0.37 T) magnetic fields applied during low-temperature hydrothermal or evaporative synthesis of the simple antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the frustrated and canted antiferromagnet atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, and the highly frustrated quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We found that (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O experiences structural changes well above its magnetic transition. Atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl synthesized under a 0.19 T field experiences a 0.15 K (~3%) decrease in its Néel transition temperature and a significant strengthening of its antiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.</p></details> | 8 figures |

Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 13figures, to be published in Phys.

Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p></details> |  |

Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17398v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large longitudinal and anomalous transverse Magneto-thermoelectric effect in kagome antiferromagnet FeGe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21361v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Giant critical current peak induced by pressure in kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21195v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
