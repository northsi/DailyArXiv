| **[Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15667v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Multiple Quasiparticle Bound States in a Trap Created by a Local Superconducting Gap Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15580v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Diode Effect due to Chiral Meissner Currents in a Hollow Superconducting Helix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15304v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conventional $s$-wave Superconductivity in LaRh$_2$As$_2$; the Analog without the 4$f$ Electrons of CeRh$_2$As$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15300v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $Δ(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs) of superconducting qubits (SCQs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing (FTSQC). Nonetheless, quantitative experimental estimation on QPG rates has remained vague. Here, we investigate QPG using strongly driven SCQs, reaching qubit drive amplitudes up to $2π\times$300 GHz by applying intense drive fields through the readout resonators. The resonator nonlinear responses enable quantification of the energy loss at SCQs, including the contribution from QPG. Surprisingly, the estimated total energy loss rates are far lower than those expected by the Floquet-Markov formalism with QPG as the sole loss mechanism. Meanwhile, calculations that incorporate high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) in the QPG conductance at approximately 17-20 GHz effectively explain the experimental observations. These results suggest limitations in either the QPG conductance model or the Markovian treatment of the QPG processes. Both possibilities possess crucial implications for handling QPG problems toward FTSQC and for a more deeper understanding of Josephson junctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been revised, and Supplementary Information has been added</p></details> |
| **[Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12988v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15023v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02429v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hearing the light: stray-field noise from the emergent photon in quantum spin ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14843v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Phase diagram of the Kitaev-Hubbard model: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin and QMC approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17089v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some layered materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The Kitaev-Hubbard (KHu) model is the minimal model that captures the essential ingredients of these systems; it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model at the strong coupling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHu model has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase diagram of the KHu model using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo on rather large systems and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are multiple magnetic phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases and most notably a quantum spin liquid phase for $1.0 \lesssim t^{\prime}/t \lesssim 1.11 $ at $U/t=5$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01513v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12570v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[2$k_F$ instability and chiral spin density wave at the 1/9 magnetization plateau in the kagome antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11670v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17144v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 14 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary Material: 12 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18250v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+9 ...</summary><p>10+9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Kagome Topology in Two-Dimensional Noble-Metal Monolayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14850v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $π$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $π$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |
| **[Computational discovery of ferromagnetic AT6X6 kagome compounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13431v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $φ$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(θ=90^{\circ},φ)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(θ,φ$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Bulk superconductivity in the kagome metal YRu3B2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09314v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials with a kagome sublattice have been heavily studied recently for their exotic electronic band structure, structural frustration, high-temperature charge order transitions, and unconventional electron-phonon coupling. In LaRu3Si2, it was proposed that electronic flat bands conspire with the characteristic phonon spectrum of the kagome lattice to drive enhanced superconductivity at Tc = 7 K. Here, we report bulk superconductivity in the structural analogue YRu3B2, which hosts a structurally pristine kagome lattice. We observe a superconducting transition at Tc = 0.7 K through magnetization, resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements in this novel kagome metal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.</p></details> |  |

Our resistivity and heat capacity measurements indicate that YRu$_3$B$_2$ is a weakly coupled superconductor, with critical temperature $T_c$ = 0.63 K and upper critical field $μ_0 H_{c2}$ (0)=0.11 T. Density functional theory calculations, together with chemical-bonding analysis, reveal that the electronic states at and near the Fermi energy level are dominated by the Ru kagome sublattice.</p></details> |  |
