| **[Soft Mode Origin of Charge Ordering in Superconducting Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19790v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Composite Superconducting Orders and Magnetism in CeRh$_2$As$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08097v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Among other results, we find that the near degeneracy of two pairing symmetries is naturally explained if and only if intralayer spin-orbit coupling is large compared to interlayer hopping. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same superconducting order parameters, albeit with distinct admixtures. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing spins at the clock transitions with a frequency- and bandwidth-tunable superconducting resonator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19684v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solid-state spin ensembles addressed via superconducting circuits are promising candidates for quantum memory applications, offering multimodal storage capability and second-long coherence times at their clock transition. Implementing practical memory schemes requires dynamic control over both the resonator frequency and bandwidth. In this letter, we report measurements of a superconducting resonator whose frequency can be tuned by passing a DC current through the high-kinetic-inductance thin film, and whose bandwidth can be tuned by parametric coupling to a low-Q buffer resonator. Using this resonator, we address an ensemble of bismuth donors at their clock transition, measuring a Hahn-echo coherence time of 450 ms. We demonstrate RF driving of the bismuth donor hyperfine transitions, as well as dynamic bandwidth control of the resonator.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Twisted superconducting quantum diodes: Towards anharmonicity and high fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19627v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable, high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05179v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, version to be published in Journal of Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism</p></details> |
| **[The Superconducting Transition due to the spontaneous Interlayer Loop Current fluctuations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19313v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAIN ...</summary><p>MAIN TEXT: 7 pages, 5 figures; SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS(attached in the end): 2 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17651v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.</p></details> |  |

Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Physical Review Letters</p></details> |

While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 ma...</summary><p>13 main pages, 6 main figures. 4 supplementary pages, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Transitions driven by multibody interactions in an effective model of active matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18076v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When out-of-equilibrium particles interact by means of pairwise forces, their stationary distribution in general exhibits many-body interactions. In the particular case of active particles, it has been shown numerically that the Motility Induced Phase Separation cannot be explained by the effective attraction emerging from two isolated particles, thereby highlighting the role of multibody interactions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of the Fox-UCNA approximation for active particles interacting by means of pairwise repulsive forces. Working at large space dimension we establish that multibody interactions up to infinite order are instrumental in giving rise to such collective phenomena as phase transitions. We recover a MIPS-like first order transition, but also find a liquid-liquid transition at somewhat lower persistence times. This new transition is connected to a spin glass phase of orientational-like degrees of freedom with disordered interactions set by the particle positions themselves.</p></details> |  |
| **[deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17668v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the components following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field which provided us a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Evidence of de Almeida-Thouless line below six dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiphoton quantum simulation of the generalized Hopfield memory model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00111v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Direct visualization of gate-tunable flat bands in twisted double bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19632v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle, displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atomic displacements drive flat band formation and lateral electron and hole separation in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19596v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers with an interlayer twist exhibit a moire super-period, whose effects can manifest in both structural and electronic properties. Atomic displacements can lead to reconstruction into domains of aligned stacking, and flat bands can form that may host correlated electron states. In heterobilayers angular mismatch is nearly unavoidable, so understanding the consequences of an interlayer twist is essential. Using ab initio density functional theory, we find that in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers valence and conduction band flat bands emerge at ~3 degree twist. Despite relatively limited reconstruction at these angles, atomic displacement creates a polarization gradient that forms a confining potential, localizing and laterally separating electrons and holes within the moire supercell. Excitons formed from flat band electrons and holes should therefore have not only the out-of-plane dipole moment familiar from MoSe2/WSe2 interlayer excitons, but an in-plane dipole moment as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 21 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Unraveling Intertwined Orders in the Strongly Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06778v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems, the ordered states that emerge from interactions in the intrinsic flat bands of kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. The newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 offers a unique and rich platform for this research, as its multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface result in a complex interplay of pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, a structural phase transition, and density wave orders. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we provide strong spectroscopic evidence for a charge density wave transition in CsCr3Sb5, resolving previous ambiguities. Crucially, we identify rotational symmetry breaking that manifests as a three-state Potts-type nematicity. Our elastoresistance measurements directly demonstrate the electronic origin of this order, as the rotational-symmetry-breaking E2g component of the elastoresistance shows a divergent behaviour around the transition temperature. This exotic nematicity results from the lifting of degeneracy of the multi-orbital flat bands, akin to phenomena seen in certain iron-based superconductors. Our study pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat-band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thouless quantum walks in topological flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02429v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Abelian gauge symmetries are cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, underlying fundamental interactions and the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. However, their potential to control quantum coherence, entangle- ment, and transport in engineered quantum systems remains to a large extent unexplored. In this work, we propose utilizing non-Abelian Thouless pumping to realize one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks on topological lattices char- acterized by degenerate flat bands. Through carefully designed pumping cycles, we implement different classes of holonomic coin and shift operators. This frame- work allows for the construction of quantum walks that encode the topological and geometric properties of the underlying system. Remarkably, the resulting evolution exhibits parity symmetry breaking and gives rise to a dynamical pro- cess governed by a Weyl-like equation, highlighting the deep connection between parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real space decay of flat band projectors from compact localized states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17258v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flatbands (FB) with compact localized eigenstates (CLS) fall into three main categories, controlled by the algebraic properties of the CLS set: orthogonal, linearly independent, linearly dependent (singular). A CLS parametrization allows us to continuously tune a linearly independent FB into a limiting orthogonal or a linearly dependent (singular) one. We derive the asymptotic real space decay of the flat band projectors for each category. The linearly independent FB is characterized by an exponentially decaying projector and a corresponding localization length $\xi$, all dressed by an algebraic prefactor. In the orthogonal limit, the localization length is $\xi=0$, and the projector is compact. The singular FB limit corresponds to $\xi \rightarrow \infty$ with an emerging power law decay of the projector. We obtain analytical estimates for the localization length and the algebraic power law exponents depending on the dimension of the lattice and the number of bands involved. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytics. Our results are of relevance for the understanding of the details of the FB quantum metric discussed in the context of FB superconductivity, the impact of disorder, and the response to local driving.</p></details> |  |

The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering phase-frustration induced flat bands in an aza-triangulene covalent Kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16126v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figues, 10 supporting information figures</p></details> |
| **[Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14039v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tunable quantum metric and band topology in bilayer Dirac models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23622v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto 1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states, which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Critical Moire Dependence with Quantum Fluctuations in Graphene Based Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15309v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for investigating flat-band-driven correlated phenomena, yet most aspects remain not understood. In this work, we systematically study the moire-dependent band topology in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. For the first time we demonstrate that the moire twist angle plays a crucial role in the formation of the moire Chern insulators in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (RHG/hBN) moire superlattices. In the moire-distant regime at filling factor v = 1, only systems with a twist angle {\theta} < 1.1{\deg} exhibit an integer moire Chern insulator, while the fractional Chern insulator at v = 2/3 requires smaller twist angle to be stabilized. Our theoretical modelling, which includes quantum fluctuations and exact diagonalization results, suggests that mean-field theory, which has been widely adopted, does not explain the twist-angle dependence of the v = 1 phase diagram, and that correlation effects are crucial. Moreover, we realize two distinct stacking configurations ( /Xi=0 and /Xi=1) between graphene and hBN, and find that both cases can yield a Chern insulator at v = 1. Our experimental work upends the current mean-field paradigm, illuminates how quantum fluctuations and moir\'e effects shape the RHG/hBN phase diagram, and paves the way for future understanding and engineering of topological correlated states in rhombohedral graphene moire systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22014v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09708v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponentially long lifetime of a Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17541v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 pages; updated main text and Supp. Mat</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Fisher Information as a Thermal and Dynamical Probe in Frustrated Magnets: Insights from Quantum Spin Ice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14813v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+11 ...</summary><p>9+11 pages, 3+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03146v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16978v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11678v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 5 figures, 8 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Spinon band flattening by its emergent gauge field in quantum kagome ice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11134v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
