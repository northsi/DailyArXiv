| **[Enhanced Superconducting Diode Effect in the Asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17452v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a nonreciprocal supercurrent, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications. However, most studies have focused on weakly correlated models, leaving the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the SDE largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by investigating the SDE in asymmetric band metals with Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interaction, which are exactly solvable due to their locality in Bloch momentum space. Through a combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor. Our findings shed light on the role of strong electron-electron correlations in shaping the SDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24415v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p></details> |  |
| **[Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between the intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to different phases. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Finite-temperature signatures of underlying superconductivity in the electron-doped Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16616v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model and analyze pairing tendencies by evaluating correlation functions at the imaginary-time midpoint ($\tau=\beta/2$), which suppresses high-frequency weight and emphasizes low-energy physics. Using this diagnostic, we identify clear finite-temperature signatures of underlying $d$-wave superconductivity for electron doping, while finding no clear indication upon cooling for hole doping. Our analysis enables direct comparison with ground-state DMRG, revealing consistent real-space pairing patterns. These results provide a practical route to bridge the gap between finite-temperature and ground-state numerically exact simulations of the Hubbard model despite the fermion sign problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Magnetic flux induced higher-order topological superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14216v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17893v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Diode effect in Shapiro steps in an asymmetric SQUID with a superconducting nanobridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15526v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Josephson diode effect in an asymmetric SQUID consisting of a sinusoidal Josephson junction formed by a Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se flake and a superconducting Nb nanobridge with a linear and multivalued current-phase relation (CPR). Current-voltage characteristics were measured both in the absence (dc regime) and presence (ac regime) of external microwave irradiation. Our dc measurements reveal only weak critical current asymmetry (i.e. weak Josephson diode effect), while confirming the multivalued behavior of the SQUID. At the same time, the key finding of this work is the observation of strong Shapiro step asymmetry (concerning the dc current direction) in the ac regime at finite magnetic flux. This peculiarity oscillates as a function of magnetic field with the SQUID's periodicity and varies non-monotonically with the increase in microwave power. Our theoretical model shows that the pronounced Shapiro step asymmetry, despite the small diode effect in critical current, arises from the interplay between the sinusoidal and multivalued CPRs of the junctions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Gap Engineering in Tantalum-Alloy-Based Resonators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15182v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing tantalum (Ta) in superconducting circuits has led to significant improvements, such as high qubit lifetimes and quality factors in both qubits and resonators, underscoring the importance of material optimization in quantum device performance. In this work, we explore superconducting gap engineering in Ta-based devices as a strategy to expand the range of viable host materials. By alloying 20 atomic percent hafnium (Hf) into Ta thin films, we achieve a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 6.09~K, as measured by DC transport, reflecting an increased superconducting gap. We systematically vary deposition conditions to control film orientation and transport properties of the Ta-Hf alloy films. The enhancement in $T_c$ is further confirmed by microwave measurements at millikelvin temperatures. Despite the 40\% increase in $T_c$ relative to pure Ta, the loss contributions from two-level systems (TLS) and quasiparticles (QPs) remain unchanged in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the potential of material engineering to improve superconducting circuit performance and motivate further exploration of engineered alloys for quantum technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15078v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14724v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures for the main text + 15 pages, 9 figures for Supplementary Materials</p></details> |

| **[deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17668v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the components following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field which provided us a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Evidence of de Almeida-Thouless line below six dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiphoton quantum simulation of the generalized Hopfield memory model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00111v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01004v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Networks of neural networks: more is different](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Beyond-classical computation in quantum simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00910v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p></details> |  |

| **[Thouless quantum walks in topological flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02429v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Abelian gauge symmetries are cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, underlying fundamental interactions and the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. However, their potential to control quantum coherence, entangle- ment, and transport in engineered quantum systems remains to a large extent unexplored. In this work, we propose utilizing non-Abelian Thouless pumping to realize one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks on topological lattices char- acterized by degenerate flat bands. Through carefully designed pumping cycles, we implement different classes of holonomic coin and shift operators. This frame- work allows for the construction of quantum walks that encode the topological and geometric properties of the underlying system. Remarkably, the resulting evolution exhibits parity symmetry breaking and gives rise to a dynamical pro- cess governed by a Weyl-like equation, highlighting the deep connection between parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real space decay of flat band projectors from compact localized states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17258v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flatbands (FB) with compact localized eigenstates (CLS) fall into three main categories, controlled by the algebraic properties of the CLS set: orthogonal, linearly independent, linearly dependent (singular). A CLS parametrization allows us to continuously tune a linearly independent FB into a limiting orthogonal or a linearly dependent (singular) one. We derive the asymptotic real space decay of the flat band projectors for each category. The linearly independent FB is characterized by an exponentially decaying projector and a corresponding localization length $\xi$, all dressed by an algebraic prefactor. In the orthogonal limit, the localization length is $\xi=0$, and the projector is compact. The singular FB limit corresponds to $\xi \rightarrow \infty$ with an emerging power law decay of the projector. We obtain analytical estimates for the localization length and the algebraic power law exponents depending on the dimension of the lattice and the number of bands involved. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytics. Our results are of relevance for the understanding of the details of the FB quantum metric discussed in the context of FB superconductivity, the impact of disorder, and the response to local driving.</p></details> |  |

The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering phase-frustration induced flat bands in an aza-triangulene covalent Kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16126v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figues, 10 supporting information figures</p></details> |
| **[Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14039v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tunable quantum metric and band topology in bilayer Dirac models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23622v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto 1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states, which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Does Moire Matter? Critical Moire Dependence with Quantum Fluctuations in Graphene Based Integer and Fractional Chern Insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15309v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for investigating flat-band-driven correlated phenomena, yet most aspects remain not understood. In this work, we systematically study the moire-dependent band topology in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. For the first time we demonstrate that the moire twist angle plays a crucial role in the formation of the moire Chern insulators in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (RHG/hBN) moire superlattices. In the moire-distant regime at filling factor v = 1, only systems with a twist angle {\theta} < 1.1{\deg} exhibit an integer moire Chern insulator, while the fractional Chern insulator at v = 2/3 requires smaller twist angle to be stabilized. Our theoretical modelling, which includes quantum fluctuations and exact diagonalization results, suggests that mean-field theory, which has been widely adopted, does not explain the twist-angle dependence of the v = 1 phase diagram, and that correlation effects are crucial. Moreover, we realize two distinct stacking configurations ( /Xi=0 and /Xi=1) between graphene and hBN, and find that both cases can yield a Chern insulator at v = 1. Our experimental work upends the current mean-field paradigm, illuminates how quantum fluctuations and moir\'e effects shape the RHG/hBN phase diagram, and paves the way for future understanding and engineering of topological correlated states in rhombohedral graphene moire systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647v5)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which are understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge-invariant momentum (gauge fields), and position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, added equations and appendices, published in PTEP</p></details> |
| **[Robust Orbital-Selective Flat Bands in Transition-Metal Oxychlorides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15080v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat electronic bands, which amplify electron correlations by quenching kinetic energy, provide an ideal foundation for exotic quantum phases. However, prevailing strategies -- including geometrically frustrated lattices, moire superlattices and heavy-fermion physics -- suffer from inherent trade-offs among robustness, tunability and orbital selectivity, limiting their broad applicability. Here, we unveil an intrinsic orbital-selective flat-band mechanism in the van der Waals materials NbOCl2 and TaOCl2, directly observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and understood through density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier analysis. Crucially, we experimentally demonstrate that this momentum-independent flat band exhibits remarkable robustness, surviving from the bulk crystal down to the few-layer limit at room temperature. Our theoretical analysis traces its origin to the hybridization between Nb-dz2 orbital chains and the Lieb-like dx2-y2 sublattice, which is further reinforced by Peierls dimerization. Our findings not only establish transition-metal oxychlorides as a robust and tunable platform for flat-band-driven correlated phases under ambient conditions, but also uncover a new orbital-selective design principle for realizing flat bands in quantum materials.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures for the main text + 15 pages, 9 figures for Supplementary Materials</p></details> |

Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponentially long lifetime of a Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17541v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+16 ...</summary><p>5+16 pages; updated main text and Supp. Mat</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+11 ...</summary><p>9+11 pages, 3+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03146v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16978v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11678v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 5 figures, 8 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Spinon band flattening by its emergent gauge field in quantum kagome ice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11134v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: 6...</summary><p>v2: 68pages, typos are corrected</p></details> |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 95 references, Supplemental Material with additional figure and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
