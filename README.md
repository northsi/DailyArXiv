| **[Scalable Superconducting Nanowire Memory Array with Row-Column Addressing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22897v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing ultra-low-energy superconducting computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing will require scalable superconducting memory. While conventional superconducting logic-based memory cells have facilitated early demonstrations, their large footprint poses a significant barrier to scaling. Nanowire-based superconducting memory cells offer a compact alternative, but high error rates have hindered their integration into large arrays. In this work, we present a superconducting nanowire memory array designed for scalable row-column operation, achieving a functional density of 2.6$\,$Mb/cm$^{2}$. The array operates at $1.3\,$K, where we implement and characterize multi-flux quanta state storage and destructive readout. By optimizing write and read pulse sequences, we minimize bit errors while maximizing operational margins in a $4\times 4$ array. Circuit-level simulations further elucidate the memory cell's dynamics, providing insight into performance limits and stability under varying pulse amplitudes. We experimentally demonstrate stable memory operation with a minimum bit error rate of $10^{-5}$. These results suggest a promising path for scaling superconducting nanowire memories to high-density architectures, offering a foundation for energy-efficient memory in superconducting electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</p></details> | <details><summary>13(+1...</summary><p>13(+19 pages appendix), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[On-demand analog space-time in superconducting networks: grey holes, dynamical instability and exceptional points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01261v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, Submission to SciPost</p></details> |
| **[Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures in main text</p></details> |
| **[Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19584v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19536v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, and ancillary files including 2 gif animations and 5 Mathematica notebooks; the reference to dataset is added in v2</p></details> |
| **[Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08704v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Mass-induced Coulomb drag in capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18943v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires. A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality.</p></details> |  |

| **[Non-classical optimization of entangled photons through complex media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24283v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of hysteresis in an isolated quantum system of disordered Heisenberg spins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18197v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 supplement</p></details> |
| **[Bias-Field Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Binary Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04477v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications. While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator. Our results show that BF-DCQO offers an effective path for solving large-scale HUBO problems on current and near-term quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 13 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Correlation thresholds in the steady states of particle systems and spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16497v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Signatures of spin-glass superconductivity in nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16412v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Tempeature Order but no Antiferromagetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Klein tunneling in deformed honeycomb-dice lattice: from massless to massive particles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10144v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Thermoelectric evidence of the electronic structure changes from the charge-density-wave transition in FeGe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19116v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.</p></details> | 4 figures |

Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in the strong-coupling regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron attractive interaction, in the case when the increase of the interaction strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that this state can be characterized by a pseudogap which is determined by the electron scattering by phase fluctuations. At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18692v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where $\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band folding on the width of the topological band.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18152v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, it has proven challenging to realize experimentally due to the difficulty of isolating this structure from any significant out-of-plane bonding while maintaining structural integrity. Here, single crystals of Zr2CuSb3, a potential candidate for the checkerboard lattice, were synthesized using the solution (self-flux) method, and their structure was confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z. Density functional theory calculations further disentangle the contributions from each high-symmetry plane, providing a comprehensive characterization of electronic behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomalous narrow-band correlation in a natural superconducting heterostructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18099v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</p></details> | under review |
