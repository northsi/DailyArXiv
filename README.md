| **[Theoretical analysis of photon detection mechanism in superconducting single-photon detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02466v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Gr\"uneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates that the electronic state does not change significantly across $3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.</p></details> | 2 pages, 2figures |
| **[Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+63 ...</summary><p>7+63 pages, 3+29 figures</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity of bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01801v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconducting thin films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Current-Gated Orthogonal Superconducting Transistor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01560v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST) and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, with Supplementary</p></details> |
| **[High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15147v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.</p></details> |  |

| **[Mean field magnetism and spin frustration in a double perovskite oxide with compositional complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02485v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides. Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04112v5)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages.

| **[Ground State Excitations and Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27507v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</p></details> | 45 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27260v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |

The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3.

Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main conclusion of the manuscript needs major revision</p></details> |

| **[Embedding independent length scale of flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02240v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5-pag...</summary><p>5-page main text with three figures</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Moiré Higher-Order Topology Beyond Effective Moiré Lattice Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00979v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moir\'e superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moir\'e lattice models. While conventional models treat moir\'e sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moir\'e site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moir\'e materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moir\'e site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moir\'e higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moir\'e hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moir\'e higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moir\'e platforms.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Temporal Scattering at Irremovable Exceptional Points in Lossless Drude Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27124v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate temporal scattering in lossless Drude media and reveal an overlooked role of the zero-frequency flat band associated with static polarization charge. This flat band forms an exceptional line spanning all wavenumbers and can be directly excited during temporal scattering at photonic time interfaces, generating non-propagating static fields alongside the usual reflected and transmitted waves. Eigenvector coalescence at the corresponding exceptional points leads to two distinctive features absent in previously studied systems: a static mode whose amplitude increases linearly with time, and an additional static component arising from the system's generalized eigenvector. Remarkably, these effects occur without violating total energy conservation, underscoring the Hermitian nature of the dynamics. Our findings present a new physical picture of temporal scattering, sharply distinct from that in dispersionless and Lorentz-dispersive media.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26798v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic insulators.These bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flux attachment theory of fractional excitonic insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05427v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.</p></details> |  |

Unlike textbook examples, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theory of correlated lattice models force us to explicitly consider sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene, where the hybridization function of the heavy-fermion-like bands to the itinerant ones displays a divergence. We clarify how this impacts the screening mechanisms by means of a toy model with a tunable $\delta$-peak in the hybridization function, superimposed to a regular part. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the flat band in the bath.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures + 17 pages, 7 figures supplemental material</p></details> |

All investigated 2D GeO2 polymorphs exhibit ultra-wide band gaps and strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |

Beyond the beta-Sb phase,with increasing deposition, once the beta-Sb coverage surpasses a threshold, we observe a previously unreported kagome-Sb overlayer. STM height maps and line profiles track a phase evolution from an enlarged-period honeycomb to a close-packed layer and ultimately a kagome lattice. XPS peak not only shows resolves a time-dependent redistribution of Sb-related components that quantitatively mirrors the STM-observed phase sequence, but also revals the substrate core levels remain unchanged, ruling out interfacial alloying throughout growth. ARPES of beta-Sb resolves a Dirac-like crossing at Gamma around -1.4 eV, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Although beta-Sb is Z2-trivial and the heterostructure is metallic, Wannier-based calculations reveal valley-contrasting Berry-curvature hotspots, yielding an intrinsic spin Hall conductivity that is strongly Fermi-level dependent. These results demonstrate a reproducible kagome-Sb/beta-Sb heterophase interface and uncover a controllable spin-orbit-driven response in a homoelemental 2D system.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, submitted</p></details> |
| **[Electronic structure of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17590v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Suppl.: 16 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to journal in July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Soft Mode Origin of Charge Ordering in Superconducting Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19790v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
