| **[Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08055v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2πm$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $Φ= b k_F^2/2$. As $Φ$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $Φ$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</p></details> | 4 pgs, 1 fg |
| **[Nanoscale observation and control of quasiparticle induced magnetic noise in a superconducting resonator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18896v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting circuits are arguably taking a leading role in driving the ongoing quantum technological revolution. A detailed knowledge of the microscopic fluctuating electromagnetic properties plays an important role in advancing the circuitry design, testing, and material integration of cutting-edge superconducting quantum electronics. Here we report scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensing of local magnetic noise environment of an on- chip superconducting resonator. We find that quasiparticle-induced fluctuating magnetic fields can drive NV spin relaxation, which shows a peak value around the superconducting transition point of niobium at the thermal equilibrium state. External microwave driving at the resonator mode frequency significantly increases the quasiparticle density, leading to enhancement of magnetic noise. We further perform optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to demonstrate quasiparticle magnetic noise mediated off-resonant dipole coupling between the NV center and niobium resonator. Our work reports experimental observation of the Hebel-Slichter peak signature by an external sensor outside of a superconductor. The presented study also highlights the advantages of quantum sensors in investigating miniaturized superconducting devices, providing insights into their future performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modulation of superconducting properties by the charge density wave at the surface of 2H-NbSe2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15554v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, we performed ultralow-temperature spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on the cleaved surface of the layered superconductor 2H-NbSe2. We found that the superconducting-gap spectrum exhibits intricate structures reflecting the anisotropic gaps opening on multiple Fermi surfaces. Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Divergent Pressure Response of Superconductivity in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ ($M$ = Fe, Ru and Ir)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15414v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying and understanding non-BCS superconductivity remains a central challenge in condensed-matter physics. Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation ($μ$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in W3Re2C with chiral structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15078v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore, the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both superconductivity and band topology.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Enhanced Charge-Density-Wave Order and Suppressed Superconductivity in Intercalated Bulk $\mathrm{Nb}{\mathrm{Se}}_{2}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14902v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electronic ground states of transition-metal dichalcogenides are strongly shaped by reduced dimensionality, yet the properties of atomically thin layers remain difficult to probe due to their small size and environmental sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that controlled electrochemical intercalation of organic cations provides a robust bulk platform for accessing monolayer-like physics in NbSe$_2$. Intercalation of tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium expands the interlayer spacing by nearly a factor of two, electronically decoupling the NbSe$_2$ layers while simultaneously introducing well-defined charge doping. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission, we uncover a pronounced enhancement of the charge-density-wave transition temperature to $\sim 130$ K together with a strong suppression of superconductivity, reproducing the phase diagram observed in exfoliated monolayers. The enhanced charge-density-wave order and reduced $T_c$ arise from the combined effects of dimensionality reduction and electron injection, and are accompanied by distinct dip-hump anomalies in the tunneling spectra suggestive of collective mode excitations. Our results establish molecular intercalation as a powerful and scalable route for engineering competing orders in layered quantum materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy for topological superconductors probed by $s$-wave superconducting tips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14537v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14500v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $ρ_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $α(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $ψ(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $α(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $ρ_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $ψ$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $α(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 4 code listings</p></details> |
| **[Exactly solvable topological phase transition in a quantum dimer model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+6 p...</summary><p>5+6 pages, 8+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Strain-tunable magnetic correlations in spin liquid candidate Nb$_3$Cl$_8$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14524v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic field induced phenomena in Kitaev spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14496v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host a variety of fractionalized particles. In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.</p></details> | 51 pages |

We find that at a given magnetization, the optimal candidate state has a finite flux chosen such that the spinon filling lies in a $|C|=1$ Landau-level gap: it gives the lowest variational energy and the smallest energy variance within our correlation-matrix reconstruction for local Heisenberg-type models. By symmetry, we argue that the finite gauge flux results in a non-zero (staggered) scalar spin chirality, as also numerically observed, and further find that the $|C|=1$ state exhibits dominant quasi-long-ranged $120^\circ$ magnetic correlations. Studying the next-to-optimal wavefunction with a $|C|=2$ Landau-level gap, we observe unusual spin-nematic correlations. Our results may provide guidance for analyzing the magnetic-field response of DSL candidate materials and offer numerical diagnostics that can connect to the underlying theory of spinons coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures; Supplementary Materials: 7 pages</p></details> |

These materials, which often appear as ultrathin, platelet-shaped crystals, are known for exotic phenomena such as superconductivity, topological order and quantum spin liquid. However, these crystals seldom reach macroscopic dimensions, making them unsuitable for conventional dilatometry techniques. By introducing a modified sample-mounting configuration, our design enables high-resolution measurements of thermal expansion and magnetostriction along in-plane crystallographic directions in samples with thicknesses well below 500 $μ$m. Validation measurements using a Quantum Design PPMS system confirm reliable performance for a 300 $μ$m-thick silver platelet, relatively hard ferromagnetic EuB$_6$ single crystals down to 50 $μ$m, and a 40 $μ$m-thin, soft AgCrS$_2$ single crystal. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The following article has been accepted by Rev.

While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+6 p...</summary><p>6+6 pages, 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 34 figures.

For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a "chiral flux" phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)m magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. In a different region of the phase diagram, strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20+12...</summary><p>20+12 pages, 11+6 figures</p></details> |

These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</p></details> |  |

In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures.

Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</p></details> | 5 Figures |

In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_χ$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_χ$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magentoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flat-band Ferromagnetism of SU$(N)$ Hubbard Model on the Kagome Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10549v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Interplay of Unidirectional Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of quantum string are observed across various quantum simulation platforms. However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, almost published version, comments are welcome, and more information at http://cqutp.org/users/xfzhang/</p></details> |

We present a combined thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) investigation of single-crystal RV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ (R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) compounds, focusing on their low-temperature magnetic behavior. Heat capacity and $μ$SR measurements reveal distinct magnetic phase transitions below 4 K, confirming the emergence of long-range magnetic order in all compounds studied. The $μ$SR results further indicate persistent spin fluctuations within the magnetically ordered state down to 50 mK, reflected in reduced ordered moments obtained from hyperfine analysis of the heat capacity measurements. These findings uncover the coexistence of static and dynamic magnetism in V-based Kagome metals and emphasizing the key role of 4$f$-electron anisotropy in shaping their magnetic ground states. Compared with the Mn-based RMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ analogs, our results highlight the unique magnetism arising from the decoupled rare-earth sublattice and its interplay with the nonmagnetic V Kagome network.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
