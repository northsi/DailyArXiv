| **[Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23150v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Andreev bound states in a superconducting qubit at odd parity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23100v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantum mechanics of the Josephson effect is the core ingredient for quantum technologies with superconducting circuits. A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Magnetic texture modulated superconductivity in superconductor/ferromagnet shells of semiconductor nanowires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22051v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $μ$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21994v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01910v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microstructure-controlled vortex phases and two-phase superconductivity in (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 revealed by ac magnetostrictive coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21599v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate flux dynamics in the high-entropy alloy superconductor (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 after annealing (as-cast, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 1000 °C) using a sensitive ac composite magnetoelectric method that measures the complex ac magnetostrictive coefficient (dλ/dH)ac. The resulting vortex phase diagrams show that intermediate annealing (500-550 °C) induces nanoscale clustering, enhances pinning, and produces a pronounced fishtail effect with successive elastic- and plastic-vortex-glass regimes. Flux-jump instabilities appear at 550 °C and persist at 1000 °C, indicating strong pinning and thermomagnetic instability in the low-temperature, low-field regime. Remarkably, the 1000 °C sample exhibits a two-step superconducting response-a double plateau or drop in dλ'/dH and two dissipation peaks in dλ''/dH-demonstrating the coexistence of two superconducting phases with distinct irreversibility and critical-field value. We further show that the resolvability of the two-step (dλ/dH)ac signature is governed by the topological connectivity of the phase-separated microstructure, which controls magnetic shielding between the TaNb-rich network and the (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 parent phase. These results establish a direct microstructure-vortex-state correlation and provide a route to tailoring flux pinning in chemically complex superconductors via thermal processing.</p></details> | 5 figures, submitted |

| **[Spiral Phase and Phase Diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ Model on the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22924v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S$=1/2 XXZ model on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice using exact diagonalization (ED), density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) with DMRG as a solver. In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[N-state Potts ices as generalizations of classical and quantum spin ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22909v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical and quantum spin ice models are amongst the most popular settings for the study of spin liquid physics. $N-$state Potts ice models have been constructed that generalize spin ice, hosting multiple emergent $\text{U}(1)$ gauge fields and excitations charged under non-trivial combinations of these fields. We present a general treatment of classical $N-$state Potts ices relating their properties to the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Lie algebras, and demonstrate how the properties of charged excitations in the classical model can be related to this symmetry group. We also introduce quantum generalizations of the Potts Ice models, and demonstrate how charge flavor changing interactions unique to $N>2$ models dominate their low energy physics. We further show how symmetries inherited from the $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ can lead to flux vacuum frustration, greatly modifying the dynamical properties of charged excitations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Anisotropic Kitaev Spin Glass in Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22280v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $β$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18845v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $η$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $η$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Competing Ordering Modes in the Distorted Quantum Kagome Material Clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21024v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collective excitations in chiral spin liquid: chiral roton and long-wavelength nematic mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20702v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral spin liquid (CSL) is a magnetic analogue of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid. Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08712v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2. N...</summary><p>v2.

| **[Unifying Dirac Spin Liquids on Square and Shastry-Sutherland Lattices via Fermionic Deconfined Criticality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19980v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $π$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced Néel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23418v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral Hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency these settings realize "Swap" models exhibiting {\it anomalous} CSL phases, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the Streda response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</p></details> | 24 pages, 21 figures |

In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p></details> |  |

An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin.

In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Non-Hermitian Second-Order Topological Phases and Bipolar Skin Effect in Photonic Kagome Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12760v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory. Our findings establish a general framework for non-Hermitian higher-order photonic systems and open avenues toward tailorable topological photonic devices exploiting non-Hermitian enhanced localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures.

| **[Magnons in multiorbital Hubbard models, from Lieb to kagome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07562v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the magnetic orders and excitations in a half-filled Hubbard model that continuously interpolates between the Lieb and kagome lattices. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</p></details> | 5 Figures |
| **[Spin Liquid Landscapes in the Kagome Lattice: A Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Chiral Heisenberg Model and Experimental Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09542v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral spin liquids, which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_χ$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_χ$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magentoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</p></details> |  |
