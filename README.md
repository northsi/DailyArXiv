| **[Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[Enhanced Superconductivity in 2H-TaS2 Devices Through in-situ Molecular Intercalation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24627v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intercalation of guest species into the gap of van der Waals materials often leads to the emergence of intriguing phenomena, such as superconductivity. While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the superconducting transition in tens-of-nm thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by gold electrodes through in-situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density wave and an increase in the superconducting transition, with an onset temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Charge stripe and superconductivity tuned by interlayer interaction in a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24405v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competing orders represent a central challenge in understanding strongly correlated systems. In this work, we employ projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model. In this model, a charge stripe phase, characterized by a peak at momentum $k_x=2\pi\delta$ is induced by highly anisotropic interlayer spin-exchange coupling $J_z$, and strongly suppressed upon introducing the spin-flip term $J_\bot$; in contrast, \(J_\perp\) favors the emergence of interlayer pairing superconductivity. We further demonstrate that the anisotropy of the interlayer spin-exchange directly governs the competition between these two phases, while the on-site interaction \(U\) plays a complex role in tuning both the charge stripe and superconductivity. Our work identifies the key factors driving charge stripe formation, highlights the sensitivity of both the charge stripe and superconducting phases to interaction parameters, and thereby provides valuable insights into competing orders in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced superconducting properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ films with sub-50-nm thickness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17367v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum geometric magnetic monopole and two-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24289v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) studies revealed that a heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ exhibits van Hove singularities and the Dirac point near the Fermi level $E_{\mathrm F}$, which are key signatures of strong-correlation effects and quantum geometry. We have constructed a two-dimensional 12-orbital \textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$ calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By solving the linearized \'{E}liashberg equation, we demonstrate that the $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of quantum geometry. The phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ under pressure is discussed in connection with the theoretical results.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Signatures of superconducting pairing driven by electron-electron interactions in moiré WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ homobilayer modelled by Hubbard Hamiltonian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24270v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moir\'e superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.</p></details> |  |

The RF system consists of a warm front-end with an RFQ and buncher cavities along with 25 superconducting cryo-modules comprised of cavities with five different acceleration \(\beta\). The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a total of 125 RF cavities. Various components of the LLRF system have been tested with and without beam at the PIP-II test stands. The LLRF system design is derived from the LCLS-II project with its self-excited loop architecture used in the majority of the cryo-modules. The PIP-II beam loading at 2 mA is much higher than the LCLS-II linac. The control system architecture is analyzed and evaluated for the operational limits of feedback gains and their ability to meet the project regulation requirements for cavity field amplitude and phase regulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Talk ...</summary><p>Talk presented at LLRF Workshop 2025 (LLRF2025, arXiv: 2510.07603)</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Superconducting Circuit Framework for Emulating Physics in Hyperbolic Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23827v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures (5 figures in main body and 7 figures in extended material)</p></details> |
| **[Pressure-induced trans-proximate correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13442v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report an unexpected trans-proximate interlayer correlation (stronger correlation between disjoint layers than the adjacent ones) in the high-pressure phase of the recently discovered La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ superconductors. Accompanied by an unusual pressure-induced fractionalization of Ni$^{2+}$ ionic spin from the standard spin-1 to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, this trans-proximate correlation results from the emergence of a cross-layer trimer in our multi-energy-scale derivation of the electron dynamics. The resulting low-energy effective description resembles that of the cuprates and suggests a universal superconducting mechanism in all existing nickelate and cuprate superconductors. The rare trans-proximate correlation not only explains the weaker superconductivity in comparison with the related La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples, but it also indicates a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate by lowering layer symmetry. Such pressure-induced trans-proximate correlation is expected in many materials and examplifies the engineering of rich uncharted quantum states of matter through pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, and the Supplemental Materials</p></details> |

We show that these defects can either enhance or suppress the superconducting critical temperature, depending on their surface density and average frequency. Using thin-film aluminium as a case study, we quantitatively describe how TLSs modify both the critical temperature and the zero-temperature superconducting gap. Our results thus highlight new opportunities for tailoring material properties through TLS engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article: 8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Monte Carlo study on critical exponents of the classical Heisenberg model in ferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25169v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasicrystals (QCs) lack three-dimensional periodicity of atomic arrangement but possess long-range structural order, which are distinct from periodic crystals and random systems. Here, we show how the ferromagnetic (FM) order arises in the icosahedral QC (i-QC) on the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation of the Heisenberg model on the Yb lattice of Cd$_{5.7}$Yb composed of regular icosahedrons. By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the critical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin correlation length, $\beta=0.508(30)$, $\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\nu=0.792(17)$, respectively. We confirmed that our data satisfy the hyperscaling relation and estimated the other critical exponents $\alpha=-0.376(51)$, $\delta=3.68(23)$, and $\eta=0.282(65)$. These results show a new universality class inherent in the i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses. In the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified into 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We revealed the FM-transition mechanism by showing that the difference in the local environment of each site is governed by cooperative evolution of spin correlations upon cooling, giving rise to the critical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cluster spin glass correlations and dynamics in Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16130v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a magnetometry, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron scattering study of the insulating face-centered-cubic spin glass Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te. The magnetometry and $\mu$SR results confirm a spin freezing transition around $T_f \approx 23$ K, with the spin fluctuation rate decreasing gradually and somewhat inhomogeneously through the sample volume as the temperature decreases toward $T_f$. Characteristic spin correlation times well above $T_f$ are on the order of 10$^{-10}$ s, in line with expectations for a cluster spin glass. Using magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling of the magnetic diffuse neutron scattering data, we show that the spin-glass ground state consists of clusters of spins exhibiting short-range-ordered type-III antiferromagnetic correlations, with a locally ordered moment of 3.1(1) $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ between nearest-neighbor spins. The type-III correlations decay exponentially as a function of spin separation distance with a correlation length of approximately 5 \AA. The diffuse magnetic scattering and corresponding mPDF show no significant changes across $T_f$, indicating that the dynamically fluctuating short-range spin correlations in the paramagnetic state retain the same basic type-III configuration; the only change apparent from the neutron scattering data is a gradual reduction of the correlation length and locally ordered moment with increasing temperature. Taken together, these results paint a unique and detailed picture of the local magnetic structure and dynamics in Zn$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$Te and show that this material is best described as a cluster spin glass. In addition, this work showcases a statistical method for extracting diffuse scattering signals from neutron powder diffraction data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin Glass Dynamics on Complex Hardware Topologies: A Bond-Correlated Percolation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24867v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how frustration and disorder shape relaxation in complex systems is a central problem in statistical physics and quantum annealing. Spin-glass models provide a natural framework to explore this connection, as their energy landscapes are governed by competing interactions and constrained topologies. We investigate the non-exponential relaxation behavior of spin glasses on network architectures relevant to quantum annealing hardware -- such as finite size Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr graphs -- where embedding constraints and finite connectivity strongly modulate the distribution of barriers and metastable states. This slow relaxation arises from the combined effects of frustration and disorder, which persist even beyond the conventional spin-glass transition. Within the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein (FKCK) cluster formalism, the appearance of unfrustrated cluster regions gives rise to multiple relaxation scales, as distinct domains follow different dynamical pathways across a rugged energy landscape. This framework enables a more comprehensive characterization of spin-glass energy landscapes and offers valuable insight into how topological constraints and disorder jointly govern relaxation dynamics, providing quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the performance and limitations of quantum annealing architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23419v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Exploring high-dimensional random landscapes: from spin glasses to random matrices, passing through simple chaotic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23138v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional random landscapes underlie phenomena as diverse as glassy physics and optimization in machine learning, and even their simplest toy models already display extraordinarily rich behavior. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of that behavior, by combining landscape-based approaches, via the Kac-Rice formalism, with dynamical approaches, paying special attention to both systems with reciprocal and with non-reciprocal interactions. After surveying core techniques and results through the spherical p-spin model, this thesis delivers three main advances: (i) exact dynamic-static comparison in a solvable class of models with non-reciprocal interactions, pinpointing differences and similarities of the two approaches; (ii) a stability-based calculation of the mean number of fixed points (i.e., annealed complexity) of the Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers random neural network, for any level of non-reciprocity; (iii) two approaches to probe the barriers and the distribution of deep local minima in the landscape of the p-spin model; (iv) some results on the overlaps among eigenvectors of spiked, correlated random matrices, which are useful to explore the geometry of energy landscapes. Together, these results sharpen our understanding of these systems, while providing new tools and opening new doors for future research directions.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |
| **[The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21982v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, we investigate the recently reported magnetic transition in B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys. The Cr sublattice is alloyed with different amounts of Co in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) B2 AlCr binary alloy and the resulting exchange interactions are analyzed within the Heisenberg Hamiltonian framework. DFT results reveal that at low Co concentrations the system favors the AFM order, while at high Co contents a transition to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is observed. Within the FM stability field, the Curie temperature (TC), obtained within the mean-field approximation, is below ~160 K and decreases with Co concentration. The calculated exchange parameters evolve systematically with Co content, and the trends are consistent with the DFT total energies. The magnetic configurations obtained from MC simulations follow the DFT results at low Cr levels but predict a spin-glass behavior for alloys containing more than 40 at.% Co on Cr sublattice. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the chemistry-driven changes in exchange interactions affect magnetism in the B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys.</p></details> |  |
| **[Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20902v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages + 32 pages appendix, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Temperature chaos as a logical consequence of the reentrant transition in spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00276v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state. Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature, we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos, offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field theory.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Unlike textbook examples, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theory of correlated lattice models force us to explicitly consider sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene, where the hybridization function of the heavy-fermion-like bands to the itinerant ones displays a divergence. We clarify how this impacts the screening mechanisms by means of a toy model with a tunable $\delta$-peak in the hybridization function, superimposed to a regular part. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the flat band in the bath.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures + 17 pages, 7 figures supplemental material</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 21 figures |

All investigated 2D GeO2 polymorphs exhibit ultra-wide band gaps and strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties in Mn- and Co-alloyed ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24564v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, submitted</p></details> |

However, existing approaches suffer from incomplete programmability and ineffective feature prediction and control mechanisms, hindering the investigation of physical phenomena on an integrated platform and limiting their translation into practical applications. Here, we present a deep learning empowered programmable topolectrical circuits (DLPTCs) platform for physical modeling and analysis. By integrating fully independent, continuous tuning of both on site and off site terms of the lattice Hamiltonian, physics graph informed inverse state design, and immediate hardware verification, our system bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical realization. Through flexible control and adiabatic path engineering, we experimentally observe the boundary states without global symmetry in higher order topological systems, their adiabatic phase transitions, and the flat band like characteristic corresponding to Landau levels in the circuit. Incorporating a physics graph informed mechanism with a generative AI model for physics exploration, we realize arbitrary, position controllable on board Anderson localization, surpassing conventional random localization. Utilizing this unique capability with high fidelity hardware implementation, we further demonstrate a compelling cryptographic application: hash based probabilistic information encryption by leveraging Anderson localization with extensive disorder configurations, enabling secure delivery of full ASCII messages.</p></details> |  |

While many investigations have thus far focused on moire flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moire realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two or more layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate the concept with twisted GeX/SnX (X=S, Se) moire superlattices and calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could host unconventional superconductivity{, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors}. The presented scheme uses 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cells as a promising platform for realizing the physical phenomena of square lattice Hubbard models, establishing a new route for studying its rich phase diagram of magnetism, charge order, and unconventional superconductivity in a highly tunable setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20911v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</p></details> | Journal upload |
| **[Low-temperature scaling laws in unconventional flat-band superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23159v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength. Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry. The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15604v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Beyond the Lowest Landau Level: Unlocking More Robust Fractional States Using Flat Chern Bands with Higher Vortexability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22831v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moir\'e flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.</p></details> |  |

This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge mean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the inclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to bilinear spin models on this lattice, where multiple magnetic phases can be degenerate in energy, often stabilizing unconventional magnetic states. In this work, we focus on one such model, parametrized by the interaction coupling $J_{z\pm}$, which defines a line in parameter space corresponding to the phase boundary between three distinct magnetic phases. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that this model exhibits an order-by-disorder mechanism at low temperatures, giving rise to a \emph{mixed} magnetic phase. This represents the first realization of a $\mathbf{q}=0$ long-range-ordered phase in a pyrochlore magnet characterized by two distinct order parameters, which we denote as the $A_2 \oplus \psi_2$ phase. Furthermore, at $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, the model acquires a subextensive number of discrete symmetries, which preclude the stabilization of conventional long-range order and instead lead to the emergence of a novel nematic phase. We characterize this nematic phase, describe how its ground-state configurations are constructed, and analyze its stability at higher temperatures and under small deviations from $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 23 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We analyze the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where a chiral spin liquid phase may exist between weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phases. We use matrix product state methods and analytical arguments to investigate this model compactified to cylinders of finite circumference. We uncover a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which, we argue, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition on odd-circumference cylinders. We numerically verify the spontaneous symmetry breaking and further demonstrate that this transition is associated with algebraic long-range correlations of various spin-singlet, charge-neutral operators. For even-circumference cylinders, the transition becomes a crossover associated with a large correlation length that grows substantially with circumference. Our findings suggest that in the two-dimensional limit, the transition to a chiral spin liquid phase is continuous and features critical fluctuations of the current.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+17 ...</summary><p>5+17 pages, 4+9 figures</p></details> |

Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+10 ...</summary><p>7+10 pages, 4+10 figures</p></details> |

The compression in the crystallographic $a$ direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions, with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However, the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1% $a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly, this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells. It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square lattice.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we show how this QED is modified via a coupling to dynamical matter on the centered pyrochlore lattice, a structure which has recently been synthesized using metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, we study the low-energy properties of the $S = 1/2$ quantum XXZ model on the centered pyrochlore lattice, with a focus on the sign-problem free region. At fourth order in degenerate perturbation theory this model hosts a quantum spin liquid distinct from the well-known U(1) quantum spin ice on the pyrochlore due to the presence of dynamical matter in the ground state. Exact diagonalization results are consistent with this quantum spin liquid over an extended region of the ground state phase diagram although potential quantum critical points within this region could indicate a richer phase structure. Our work thus expands the physics of quantum spin ice in an experimentally motivated geometry, showing how the emergent QED can be coupled to dynamical matter at zero temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 20 figures, updated published version</p></details> |
| **[Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20902v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages + 32 pages appendix, 12 figures</p></details> |

Several key questions remain to be answered, such as the magnitude of Kitaev couplings in cobaltates and how to engineer those, by either chemical or physical means. Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ Co$^{2+}$ oxide, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are substantial and antiferromagnetic but somewhat weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma'$, all nearest-neighbor couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the limits of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets and the way of tuning intersite couplings towards the Kitaev spin liquid ground state.</p></details> |  |

Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, submitted</p></details> |

Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy.

Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</p></details> | 10+18 pages |
| **[Unraveling Intertwined Orders in the Strongly Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06778v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While correlated phenomena of flat bands have been extensively studied in twisted systems, the ordered states that emerge from interactions in the intrinsic flat bands of kagome lattice materials remain largely unexplored. The newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 offers a unique and rich platform for this research, as its multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface result in a complex interplay of pressurized superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, a structural phase transition, and density wave orders. Here, using ultrafast optical techniques, we provide strong spectroscopic evidence for a charge density wave transition in CsCr3Sb5, resolving previous ambiguities. Crucially, we identify rotational symmetry breaking that manifests as a three-state Potts-type nematicity. Our elastoresistance measurements directly demonstrate the electronic origin of this order, as the rotational-symmetry-breaking E2g component of the elastoresistance shows a divergent behaviour around the transition temperature. This exotic nematicity results from the lifting of degeneracy of the multi-orbital flat bands, akin to phenomena seen in certain iron-based superconductors. Our study pioneers the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in flat-band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into the interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attaining the Ground State of Kagome Artificial Spin Ice via Ultrafast Site-Specific Laser Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17416v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial spin ices (ASIs) provide a versatile platform to explore magnetic frustration and emergent phenomena. However, in kagome ASI, experimental access to the ground state remains elusive due to dynamical freezing. Here, we demonstrate a deterministic and rewritable approach to attain the ground state using ultrafast, site-selective laser annealing. By engineering sublattice-dependent optical absorption through selective capping of the nanomagnets with Cr or utilizing different nanomagnet thicknesses, we achieve selective partial demagnetization of one sublattice under a sub-coercive magnetic field, driving the system into the ground state in a single switching step. Magnetic force microscopy reveals nearly perfect long-range ordering, while heat-transfer simulations confirm the sublattice-selective excitation mechanism. This work establishes an ultrafast method to attain the kagome ASI ground state, which does not require a modification of the geometry of the ASI or the materials used for the individual nanomagnets. Beyond ground-state writing, this site-selective activation provides an important tool for controlling the magnetic states, which is important for applications such as reconfigurable magnonic crystals, neuromorphic computing and programmable nanomagnetic logic.</p></details> | 5 figures |
