| **[Strain-tuned structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23630v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Photogalvanic and photon drag phenomena in superconductors and hybrid superconducting systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23516v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we review the recent progress in theoretical understanding of the peculiarities of photogalvanic phenomena, photon drag and inverse Faraday effects in superconductors and hybrid superconducting structures. Our study is based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory with a complex relaxation constant which provides the simplest description of the mechanisms of the second-order nonlinear effects in the electrodynamic response and related mechanisms of generation of dc photocurrents, magnetic moment and switching between different current states under the influence of electromagnetic radiation of various polarization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $β_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$Φ_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+20 ...</summary><p>7+20 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Effect of superconductivity by Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22430v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[$p$-wave superconductivity and Josephson current in $p$-wave unconventional magnet/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18636v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective $p$-wave unconventional magnet model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Criticality as a Universal Thermodynamic Requirement for Perfect Intrinsic Superconducting Diodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21384v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $ε= I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+>I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $ε=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $ε\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $ε$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $ε$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Quantum Geometry Induced Kekulé Superconductivity in Haldane phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21791v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21213v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21199v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Distinct Suppression Mechanisms of Superconductivity by Magnetic Domains and Spin Fluctuations in EuFe2(As1-xPx)2 superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20364v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.</p></details> |  |

| **[Random geometry of maximum-density dimer packings of the site-diluted kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23639v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work that analyzed the effect of vacancy disorder on a short-range resonating valence bond spin liquid state of kagome-lattice antiferromagnets argued that such spin liquids are stable to vacancy disorder. The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23418v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</p></details> | 23 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Fractionalized Fermi liquids and the cuprate phase diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164v6)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in spin density wave theory. Magnetotransport measurements, including observation of the Yamaji angle, show clear evidence of hole pocket quasiparticles which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and are consistent with the FL* description. The FL* phase of a single-band model is described using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid (FL) at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of the FL*-FL metal-metal transition without a symmetry-breaking order parameter, using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to two spatial dimensions. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 43 figures.

| **[Kitaev interaction and possible spin liquid state in CoI2 and Co2/3Mg1/3I2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22453v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI$_2$, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ion is in the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping via the strong Co 3$d$-I 5$p$ hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction ($K_1$) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction $J_1$. The resultant $|K_1/J_1|$ = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction $J_3$ gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI$_2$. We then propose to suppress the $J_3$ using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co$_{2/3}$Mg$_{1/3}$I$_2$ has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating triangle Hofstadter-Hubbard model with fermionic projected entangled simplex states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21503v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram. Our work demonstrates robust chiral superconductivity in the thermodynamic limit through doping Chern insulator and CSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obstructed Cooper Pairs in Line-Graph Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17815v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doping a Mott insulator is widely expected to produce mobile Cooper pairs whose kinetic energy sets the superfluid stiffness. Here we demonstrate a striking counterexample. We show that when doped charges propagate on the line-graph of a lattice with strong pairing interaction, they bind into obstructed Cooper pairs whose motion is frustrated by destructive interference. As a result, the leading-order pair kinetic energy vanishes identically in the strong-coupling expansion, producing a flat bosonic band of compact localised pair states and a vanishing superfluid stiffness at leading order. The low-energy Hilbert space is dominated by these localised pairs, yielding an extensively degenerate ground-state manifold and a superfluid stiffness that vanishes anomalously as the third inverse power of the pairing strength. At quarter filling, the frustrated pair dynamics maps onto a quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, realizing a d-wave resonating-valence-bond spin liquid with topological ground-state degeneracy and deconfined holon excitations. Our results establish a disorder-free mechanism for interaction-driven localization, in which strong pairing collapses the kinetic energy of Cooper pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision, connections between strong-coupling superconductivity and frustrated magnetism, new mapping to quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point with exact d-wave spin-liquid ground state, vanishing superfluid stiffness grounded in explicit calculation of strong-pairing stiffness, extensive many-body ground state degeneracies evaluated with exact diagonalization, and 9 new figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing magnetic and topological orders in the spin-1 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain with single-ion anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20912v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev--Heisenberg chain in the presence of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy (SIA) $D_z$ by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $φ$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |

Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>the f...</summary><p>the first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$Γ$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $Γ$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Evidence of Mott Insulator with Thermally Induced Melting Behavior in Kagome Compound Nb3Cl8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08730v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice provides a playground to explore novel correlated quantum states due to the presence of flat bands in its electronic structure. Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4figures |
| **[Multiple topological phases of magnons induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and pseudodipolar anisotropic exchange interactions in Kagome ferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20297v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11322v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Spectral Function of the Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18831v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Observation of multiple flat bands and van Hove singularities in the distorted kagome metal NdTi3Bi4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11488v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to their diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation. Here, we present the electronic structure of a distorted ferromagnetic kagome metal, NdTi3Bi4, exhibiting a transition temperature of 9 K. Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, Supplementary Information included</p></details> |

We establish a 2-to-1 correspondence between the configurations of trimers on the kagome lattice to the covering by dimers of a related hexagonal lattice to show that entropy of coverings per trimer $s_{\text{tri,kag}}$ equals the entropy per dimer $ s_{\text{dim,hex}} $, and is given by $ s_{\text{tri,kag}} = s_{\text{dim,hex}} = \frac{1}{2 π} \int_0^{ 2 π/3} \log( 2 + 2 \cos k) dk \approx 0.323065947\ldots$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Single Ion Anisotropy of $Ln^{3+}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho) Controls Magnetic Excitations in $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ Ferrimagnetic Kagome Metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17715v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ family of materials, where $Ln^{3+}$ is a lanthanide trivalent cation, have attracted extensive interest due to the interplay of electronic structure, magnetism, and topology present in this family that gives rise to complex electronic and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages main text, 41 total including supplementary info, 4 main figures, 40 supplementary figures</p></details> |
