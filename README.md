| **[Coexisting magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders in the two-dimensional Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20073v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic drive induced unconventional superconductivity in a half-filled system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19920v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The non-equilibrium control of electronic properties has emerged as a transformative paradigm for engineering novel quantum phases. The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Transcendental momentum quantization in semiconducting Rashba nanowires and zero energy states in their normal and superconducting phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19796v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study finite system properties of the canonical low energy model for a semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The case of an isolated wire as well as of one proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are considered. Already for the normal wire, the presence of spin-orbit coupling leads to eigenstates of the finite system composed of more than two momentum eigenstates. The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates. In this case we derive an approximate quantization condition close to the phase boundary, and a condition for the appearance of exact zero energy states. It can be satisfied both in the topological and in the trivial phase. Both the trivial and topological zero energy states contribute to the linear transport through Andreev reflection and direct transmission processes, with their relative importance depending on the degree of the states' localization at the boundary.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC loss modelling in a 2 MW-class REBCO high temperature superconducting motor for hydrogen-electric aircraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19731v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High temperature superconducting motors are very promising for hydrogen-electric aircraft thanks to their high specific power, specific torque, and efficiency. High temperature superconductor REBCO offer high cryogenic flexibility, but a stator made of REBCO tapes could present high AC loss. Although stacking effect reduce AC loss, it could be compromised by imperfections, such as winding misalignment and tape inhomogeneity. Therefore, it is needed to know whether the AC loss is acceptable in realistic REBCO stators. This article analyses the AC loss in a REBCO propulsion motor for aviation that takes these imperfections into account. For this purpose, we developed our own fast and accurate numerical model, which considers the highly nonlinear screening currents in the superconductor into account. This work studies a motor of around 2 MW power with REBCO stator coils with 27 parallel tapes as conductor and a permanent-magnet rotor. We consider several electric coupling scenarios of the multi-tape conductor. We also analyze the effect of finite tape-to-tape resistances at the terminals. We have found that the AC loss for the whole motor in the most realistic coupling scenario represents less than 0.018 % of the rated power. Misalignments and tape degradation at the edges of up to 100 $μ$m only increase AC loss by up to around 20 %. Therefore, motors with REBCO superconductors in the stator are feasible for aircraft propulsion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropic fully-gapped superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19724v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ emerges from an exotic, non-metallic normal state that exhibits signatures of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, emergent symmetry and excitonic order. The high upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ suggests that that the favored pairing state is spin-triplet in nature. Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth down to $0.08\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.04$) and the specific heat down to $0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.2$), and show that they are consistent with a moderately-coupled, fully-gapped superconducting state with marked gap anisotropy and a minimum ($Δ_{\rm min} \simeq 0.4\,k_{\mathrm{B}}T_c$) occurring over a very narrow region in $k$-space. Combined with knowledge of $H_{c2}$, these measurements support the presence of a nodeless and possibly odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting order parameter in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Robust two-dimensional surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $γ$-PtBi$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04867v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The layered compound $γ$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found signatures of surface superconductivity consisting of gap openings compatible with a critical temperature orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence. Here we use very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and find robust superconductivity with T$_C=$2.9 K and H$_{C2}\approx$1.8 T linked to the Fermi arcs. We observe quantized superconducting vortices, demonstrating two-dimensional macroscopic quantum phase coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imaging the Superconducting Proximity Effect in S-S'-S Transition Edge Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19399v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximity effects at superconducting interfaces, between different superconductors (S-S') or between superconductors and normal metals (S-N), are fundamental to the performance of superconducting electronics, yet only few experiments have directly probed the spatial structure of proximity effects within a device. This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations. By providing spatially resolved measurements of the interplay of proximity effects in TES devices, this work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling superconducting states in heterogeneous superconducting structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insight into high-entropy effect in body-centered cubic superconducting alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19376v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have characterized the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), the Debye temperature ($θ_\mathrm{D}$), the electronic specific heat coefficient, and the Vickers microhardness of HfNbTiVZr, NbTiZr, HfNbTi, HfNbZr, and HfNbTa, all possessing a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. By compiling a comparable dataset for other equiatomic quinary bcc high-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors, we have examined the validity of the hypothesis regarding the high-entropy effect in bcc HEA superconductors, as proposed in our previous work. This hypothesis attributes the observed negative correlation between the electron-phonon coupling constant ($λ_\mathrm{e-p}$) and $θ_\mathrm{D}$ to a reduced phonon lifetime at higher $θ_\mathrm{D}$, arising from the uncertainty principle in highly disordered quinary alloys. However, a pronounced change in this negative correlation is not evident in equiatomic ternary alloys with a lower degree of atomic disorder, thereby providing limited support for the hypothesis. Alternatively, by assembling the full dataset of bcc alloys spanning binary through senary systems, we have identified a universal negative correlation between $λ_\mathrm{e-p}$ and $θ_{D}$. This result would be useful for the materials design of bcc superconducting alloys. We further propose that the Vickers microhardness offers an alternative means to evaluate $θ_{D}$ and may serve as a rapid screening metric for identifying bcc alloys with desired properties.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exactly Solvable Topological Phase Transition in a Quantum Dimer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+12 ...</summary><p>5+12 pages, 6+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin liquids in spin-1 pyrochlore magnets: nematic Coulomb phase, intrinsic spin glass, and its realization in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12776v3)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for spin liquids, magnetic phases which lie outside the Landau paradigm, remains one of the central challenges for modern condensed matter physics. Here, motivated by NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, we use numerical simulation to explore the phases which arise in a minimal model of a spin-1 pyrochlore magnet, once quadrupole moments are taken into account. We identify seven distinct Coulombic spin liquid phases, including one with nematic correlations. Through quantitative comparison with inelastic neutron scattering, we show that this nematic spin liquid provides a compelling scenario for both the spin liquid observed in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, and its spin glass transition, without the need to invoke disorder. These results highlight the great wealth of unconventional phases which arise for magnetic ions capable of supporting both dipole and quadrupole moments.</p></details> | 62 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15020v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Competing states in the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model: a dynamical density-matrix renormalization group study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14892v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5+9...</summary><p>5+5+9 pages, 3+3+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14769v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+6 figures</p></details> |

In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 8...</summary><p>8 + 8 pages, 3 + 6 figures</p></details> |

| **[Energy gap of quantum spin glasses: a projection quantum Monte Carlo study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20108v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $Δ$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus additional material</p></details> |

When two systems with independent disorders are coupled, their overlaps become similar. A crucial question is how this effect depends on the strength of the coupling between the two systems. Non-perturbative phenomena are present when $1 \ll ΔH \ll N$, being $ΔH$ the coupling Hamiltonian and $N$ the size of the system. In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to PNAS</p></details> |

The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16665v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18963v3)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and therefore difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica methods in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce replica Markov processes, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of the dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions. Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the Rényi and Tsallis entropies, where the bounds involve the initial dynamical activity. Analogous bounds can be derived for the entropies of the state distribution. In particular, we provide upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy of state distributions. Moreover, we show that the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the state distribution are bounded from above by terms involving the local escape rate from the initial node. We also illustrate how replicas can be used to study other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
