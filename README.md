| **[Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04629v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.</p></details> | 42 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Stability and Superconductivity of Ternary Polyhydrides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22877v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review five years of experimental and theoretical attempts (2020-2025) to enhance the superconducting critical temperature ($\textit{T$_c$}$) of hydrogen-rich compounds by alloying binary superhydrides with additional elements. Despite predictions of higher $\textit{T$_c$}$ in ternary systems such as La-Y-H, La-Ce-H, and Ca-Mg-H, experiments consistently show that the maximum $\textit{T$_c$}$ in disordered ternary superhydrides does not exceed that of the best binary parent hydrides within experimental uncertainty. Instead, alloying primarily stabilizes high-symmetry polyhydride phases at lower pressures, enabling $\textit{T$_c$}$ = 200 K near 110-120 GPa, while also improving vortex pinning and upper critical fields. Magnetic dopants suppress $\textit{T$_c$}$, whereas nonmagnetic additives leave it nearly unchanged, reminiscent of Anderson's theorem. These findings indicate that alloying is unlikely to raise $\textit{T$_c$}$, but can reduce the pressures required to stabilize high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ phases. We propose that fully ordered ternary hydrides, synthesized via controlled hydrogenation of intermetallic precursors, offer a promising route toward this goal. One of the most promising compounds of this kind is the recently discovered LaSc$_2$H$_{24}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin responses of a disordered helical superconducting edge under Zeeman field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04263v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[High-Tc superconductivity above 130 K in cubic MH4 compounds at ambient pressure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04222v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Superconducting Properties on Two-dimensional Quasicrystal (Ta$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$)$_{1.6}$Te Studied with $^{125}$Te-NMR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04208v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical properties in the normal and superconducting (SC) state are investigated with $^{125}$Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in a quasicrystal $\mathrm{(Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te}$, which was a recently discovered superconductor with the SC transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 0.94 K. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows a coherence peak just below $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, followed by an exponential decrease down to 0.1 K. The overall temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ is in good agreement with an $s$-wave SC model with a SC gap slightly smaller than the BCS value. However, the coherence peak is unusually small, which may be attributable to a reduced Bogoliubov peak theoretically predicted for quasicrystals. Furthermore, $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra show almost no broadening nor shift in the SC state, suggesting that an unusual SC state such as parity mixing might be realized in the Ta$_{1.6}$Te superconductor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anharmonicity and Coulomb pseudopotential effects on superconductivity in YH$_6$ and YH$_9$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03383v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anharmonic effects are widely believed to be the primary cause of the overestimation of superconducting transition temperatures of yttrium hydrides YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ in theoretical predictions. However, prior studies indicate that anharmonicity alone may be insufficient to account for this discrepancy. In this work, we employ the stochastic path-integral approach to investigate the quantum and anharmonic effects of ions in yttrium hydrides. Our calculations reveal significant corrections to the electron-phonon coupling parameters and an increase in the average phonon frequency compared to density functional perturbation theory, aligning closely with results from the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We find that properly taking into account the renormalization of the Coulomb pseudopotential due to the frequency cutoff, which is often overlooked in previous calculations, is critical to predicting transition temperatures consistent with experimental values for both YH$_6$ and YH$_9$. This indicates that, with this correction, anharmonic effects are sufficient to explain the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Vortex-Controlled Quasiparticle Multiplication and Self-Growth Dynamics in Superconducting Resonators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03853v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation. At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within $\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of $\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |

An inelastic Cooper pair tunneling accompanied by the emission of Leggett plasmons has been found for the first time in $MgB_2$ Josephson contacts. A fine structure in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts caused by a resonant emission of Leggett plasmons has been observed for the first time. An energy of the Leggett plasmon has been estimated: $E_0$ ~ 4 meV. Distinct two-gap structures have been found in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ tunneling contacts and $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts with 7.5 meV $< \Delta_L <$ 11 meV and 1.5 meV $< \Delta_S <$ 2.5 meV. An intrinsic tunneling effect (ITE) and intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) have been observed due to the layered structure of $MgB_2$. The obtained experimental results give a direct evidence for a two-gap superconductivity in $MgB_2$. ("V.

In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Compared to the previous version, we establish an improved zero-free result for the second moment regime</p></details> |
| **[Mean field magnetism and spin frustration in a double perovskite oxide with compositional complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02485v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides. Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04112v5)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages.

| **[Ground State Excitations and Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27507v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</p></details> | 45 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27260v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |

The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main conclusion of the manuscript needs major revision</p></details> |

| **[Strain and twist angle driven electronic structure evolution in twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20040v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) devices, local strains frequently coexist and intertwine with the twist-angle-dependent moir\'e superlattice, significantly influencing the electronic properties of TBG, yet their combined effects remain incompletely understood. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we study a TBG device exhibiting both a continuous twist-angle gradient from 0.35{\deg} to 1.30{\deg} and spatially varying strain fields, spanning the first (1.1{\deg}), second (0.5{\deg}) and third (0.3{\deg}) magic angles. We visualize the evolution of flat and remote bands in energy and real space with atomic resolution. Near the first magic angle, we discover an anomalous spectral weight transfer between the two flat band peaks, signifying the role of strain and electronic correlations, as further evidenced by an unusual spatial dispersion of these peaks within a moir\'e unit cell. In contrast, remote band peak energy offers a strain-insensitive indicator of the local twist angle. Structural analysis further reveals non-negligible shear strain across the sample. All observations are quantitatively reproduced by a continuum model that incorporates heterostrain and a self-consistent Hartree potential, revealing the critical but unexplored role of shear strain in shaping the low-energy electronic landscape of TBG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy transport and chaos in a one-dimensional disordered nonlinear stub lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04159v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Measuring non-Abelian quantum geometry and topology in a multi-gap photonic lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03894v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flat Chern bands and correlated states in spiral magnet ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We predict the van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ hosts isolated flat Chern bands at the Fermi level in its $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic ground state. Their flatness and nontrivial topology arise from the cooperative effect of coplanar spin order and strong spin-orbit coupling within Re $5d$ orbitals-a mechanism distinct from moir\'e systems. The spiral spin texture naturally enlarges the unit cell, reducing carrier densities while preserving sizable interaction scales. Many-body calculations show that fractional fillings can support fractional Chern insulator and charge-density wave states. Remarkably, the mechanism is generic to a broad family of Re-based compounds, with both spin configuration and flat band topology tunable by electrical manipulation. Our findings establish Re-based coplanar antiferromagnets as a robust, tunable, and experimentally accessible platform for flat Chern bands and correlated topological phases potentially at elevated temperatures.</p></details> |  |

Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections $t^{a,c}$, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field . At $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For $0 < \alpha < 1$, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within $0 < \alpha < 1$ suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At $\alpha = 1$, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in *Advanced Quantum Technologies* (Wiley-VCH), 2025.

| **[Embedding independent length scale of flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02240v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5-pag...</summary><p>5-page main text with three figures</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Moiré Higher-Order Topology Beyond Effective Moiré Lattice Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00979v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moir\'e superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moir\'e lattice models. While conventional models treat moir\'e sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moir\'e site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moir\'e materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moir\'e site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moir\'e higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moir\'e hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moir\'e higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moir\'e platforms.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature.

This flat band forms an exceptional line spanning all wavenumbers and can be directly excited during temporal scattering at photonic time interfaces, generating non-propagating static fields alongside the usual reflected and transmitted waves. Eigenvector coalescence at the corresponding exceptional points leads to two distinctive features absent in previously studied systems: a static mode whose amplitude increases linearly with time, and an additional static component arising from the system's generalized eigenvector. Remarkably, these effects occur without violating total energy conservation, underscoring the Hermitian nature of the dynamics. Our findings present a new physical picture of temporal scattering, sharply distinct from that in dispersionless and Lorentz-dispersive media.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+4 ...</summary><p>14+4 pages, 6+5 figures</p></details> |

These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagom\'e lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</p></details> |  |

While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state. Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential quantum liquid phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 figures.

Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19728v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagom\'e lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the Kagom\'e magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</p></details> |  |

Using the triangle group $\Delta(2,8,8)$ as an example, we classify all inequivalent projective symmetry groups by computing the second cohomology group $H^2(\Delta(2,8,8),\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Each class corresponds to a distinct flux configuration and can be constructed by tight-binding models to verify the symmetry relations of the extended group. The translation subgroups of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extended lattices are associated with high genus surfaces, which follows the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. By applying the Abelian hyperbolic band theory, we find the all-flat dispersions along specific directions in momentum space and van Hove singularities correlated with discrete eigenenergies. Our results establish a general route to investigate gauge-extended hyperbolic lattices and provide a foundation for further studying symmetry fractionalization and spin liquid phases in non-Euclidean geometries.</p></details> |  |

In an earlier paper [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. B 98, 140402(R) (2018)] we have shown how these features are linked to the local constraints realized in classical spin liquids. Here we explore their implication for the topology of magnon bands. The presence of half moons indicates a separation of magnetic degrees of freedom into irrotational and incompressible components. Where bands satisfying these constraints meet, it is at a singular point encoding Berry curvature of $\pm 2\pi$. Interactions which mix the bands open a gap, resolving the singularity, and leading to bands with finite Berry curvature, accompanied by characteristic changes to half--moon motifs. These results imply that inelastic neutron scattering can, in some cases, be used to make rigorous inference about the topological nature of magnon bands.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, and supplemental materials</p></details> |

Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.</p></details> |  |

The pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. Here, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with anisotropy exceeding 80% and a gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originating from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the Fermi surface occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our direct observation of the Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic pairing in CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding the intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Communications Materials</p></details> |

To date, the predominant experimental evidence centers around unconventional charge order, nematicity, and superconductivity, while magnetic fluctuations due to electronic interactions, i.e., beyond local atomic magnetism, have largely been elusive. We find the challenge of locating the appropriate parameter regime for such exotic order to center around two aspects. First, the correlations implied by low-energy orbitals have to be sufficiently large to yield a dominance of magnetic fluctuations and weak to retain an itinerant parent state. Second, the kinematic kagome profile at the Fermi level demands an efficient mitigation of sublattice interference causing the suppression of magnetic fluctuations descending from electronic on-site repulsion. We elucidate our methodology by analyzing the potential copper-based kagome compound CsCu$_3$Cl$_5$: From ab initio design and many-body analysis, we develop a model framework of realistic Cu-based kagome materials the simulations of which reveal unconventional magnetic order in a kagome metal.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and transition to another magnetic phase, with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting), below ~270 K. Thus, our theory and experiment suggest the existence and sequence of collinear and noncollinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism.</p></details> |  |

Beyond the beta-Sb phase,with increasing deposition, once the beta-Sb coverage surpasses a threshold, we observe a previously unreported kagome-Sb overlayer. STM height maps and line profiles track a phase evolution from an enlarged-period honeycomb to a close-packed layer and ultimately a kagome lattice. XPS peak not only shows resolves a time-dependent redistribution of Sb-related components that quantitatively mirrors the STM-observed phase sequence, but also revals the substrate core levels remain unchanged, ruling out interfacial alloying throughout growth. ARPES of beta-Sb resolves a Dirac-like crossing at Gamma around -1.4 eV, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Although beta-Sb is Z2-trivial and the heterostructure is metallic, Wannier-based calculations reveal valley-contrasting Berry-curvature hotspots, yielding an intrinsic spin Hall conductivity that is strongly Fermi-level dependent. These results demonstrate a reproducible kagome-Sb/beta-Sb heterophase interface and uncover a controllable spin-orbit-driven response in a homoelemental 2D system.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned.

Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state.
