| **[Boosting superconductivity in ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films via nanofaceted substrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03986v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the doping level is fixed during synthesis, hence the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike in 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05662v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16578v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</p></details> | 27 pages, 28 figures |
| **[Effect of Underlayer Induced Charge Carrier Substitution on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20242v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder, yet yields the highest TC. This indicates that in the Ti40V60 alloys, a moderate amount of disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations (inherent to the alloy system) induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the film with V under-layer and the film without under-layer, and the much smaller coherence length (~6.2 nm) as compared to the film thickness (25 nm), confirm the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries in Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05326v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signs of Possible High-Temperature Superconductivity in Graphite Intercalated with Lithium-Based Alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03256v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report experimental results indicating possible high-temperature superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds synthesized with lithium-based alloys. Temperature-dependent measurements of magnetization, trapped magnetic flux, and electrical resistance reveal transitions with critical temperatures (Tc) in the range of 240-350 K at ambient pressure, depending on intercalation metals and conditions. The highest Tc values and largest high-Tc fractions (< 0.1 %) were observed in graphite samples intercalated with ternary Sr-Ca-Li alloy. Our results and analyses suggest that the observed transitions originate from local superconductivity rather than intrinsic magnetic properties of the intercalated graphite, which may be an alternative explanation. Accordingly, we propose and intend to pursue further investigations to test and confirm the nature of the observed high-Tc transitions, and to obtain larger high-Tc fractions by optimizing the intercalation materials and methods.</p></details> | Added references |
| **[Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+11 ...</summary><p>6+11 pages, 5+6 figures; the first two authors contributed equally to this work. v2 expands discussion on experimental signatures and pairing mediated by Goldstone modes</p></details> |
| **[Single-enantiomer spin polarisers in superconducting junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04772v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04712v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $Δ_{L}$ with $2Δ_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $Δ_S$ yielding $2Δ_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</p></details> | 6 pages,5 figures |

| **[Building cluster systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Competing Paramagnetic Phases in the Maple-Leaf Heisenberg Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05308v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05336v6)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the finite-doping sign problem is evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We compute quantum oscillations in the density of states, and predict signatures of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates, despite the absence of hole pockets in photoemission and STM. A regime with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order is needed, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order. We also note distinctive features of the theory in the electron spectral function above the Fermi energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures. v5 Added co-author and predictions for electronic spectrum above the Fermi energy</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25539v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Dominant Kitaev Interaction and Field-induced Quantum Disordered Phase in the Cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01957v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we propose an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spectroscopic Demarcation of Emergent Photons and Spinons in a Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03202v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$, the candidate $π$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\text{Ce}_2\text{Zr}_2\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $π$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 32 figures.

| **[Spin-orbit coupling controlled two-dimensional magnetism in chromium trihalides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16709v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $λ_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. Finding direct evidence for Kitaev interaction and determining its value has been an essential but formidable challenge in Kitaev physics. Here we report the direct Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal symmetric $Γ$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. $K$ and $Γ$ exhibit dominant dependencies on $λ_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides a foundation for designing 2D magnetic materials exhibiting novel behaviors by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Instabilities of the Fractionalized Dirac Semimetal in the Kitaev-Kondo Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02110v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</p></details> |  |

| **[Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05735v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Phase transitions and crtical exponents in the six-vertex model on kagome lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00804v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the experimental realization of direct kagome spin ice [Yue et al., Nat. Nanotechnol. 19, 1101 (2024)], the theoretical six-vertex model on the kagome lattice is systematically simulated using the directed loop Monte Carlo method. Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $k=1$. (ii) ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $k=-2$ on the honeycomb faces and $k=1$ on the triangular faces. (iii) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $k=1$; and (iv) paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $k=1$. As for ferromagnetic to different types of paramagnetic phase, besides the Ising universality class with $y_t=1$, varying critical exponents have also been found with different values of vertex weights. The transition between the third type and fourth type of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$.

The crystal structure was determined by using single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CrGe1-xSe3+y crystallizes with a space group R-3m, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms, sandwiched between disordered Ge-Se layers. This compound displays antiferromagnetic order below 50 K, unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in CrGeTe3. Chromium displays an effective moment of ~3.9 μB/Cr, consistent with Cr3+ oxidation. The presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic CrGeSe3 analogous to CrGeTe3.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(θ,φ)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $φ$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(θ= 90^{\circ}, φ)$. In contrast, for fixed $φ$, the transitions driven by varying $θ$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane. These findings establish CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ as a promising candidate for exploring electrically tunable flat-band correlations and topological magnetism in a multiferroic monolayer.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuneable skyrmion and anti-skyrmion fluids via mechanical strain in chiral kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00982v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in the kagome Hubbard model under the flat-band-preserving disorder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00540v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.</p></details> |  |
