| **[Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum Lyapunov control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20426v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Anisotropy by design in superconducting Nb thin films via ultrashort pulse laser irradiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24862v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Quantum superconducting diode effect with perfect efficiency above liquid-nitrogen temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24764v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superconducting diode is an emergent device that juggles between the Cooper-paired state and the resistive state with unpaired quasiparticles. Here, we report a quantum version of the superconducting diode, which operates solely between Cooper-paired states. This type of quantum superconducting diode takes advantage of quantized Shapiro steps for digitized outputs. The devices consist of twisted high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and exhibit the following distinguished characteristics: (1) a non-reciprocal diode behavior can be simply initiated by current training without applying an external magnetic field; (2) perfect diode efficiency is achieved under microwave irradiations at a record-high working temperature; (3) the quantized nature of the output offers high resilience against input noises. These features open up unprecedented opportunities toward developing practical dissipationless quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong Correlations and Superconductivity in the Supermoir√© Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24670v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supermoir\'e lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moir\'e patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moir\'e flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoir\'e lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoir\'e lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoir\'e mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoir\'e lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoir\'e lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moir\'e flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoir\'e lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24415v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ideal quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03617v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay of quantum geometry and interactions determines the correlated state properties of flat bands. Here, we investigate the ideal quantum geometry (IQG), i.e., the property that the trace of quantum metric equals the Berry curvature, in the surface flat bands of rhombohedrally stacked graphene (RG) multilayers. We show that RG represents a class of semimetals with IQG, among which only RG has a nonvanishing IQG at the center of the surface bands. In the presence of long-range hoppings, a displacement field polarizes the electron density to one of the two surfaces, stabilizing the IQG and boosting transitions to correlated phases like superconductivity. Analyzing the superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state in a many-layer RG, we reveal a heavy-fermion picture where the "heavy electrons" carry a nonzero supercurrent. This unusual behavior arises from the IQG of the surface states, which suggests a large fraction of supercurrent running on the surface of RG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity Proximate to Non-Abelian Fractional Spin Hall Insulator in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23904v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ near two-degree twists has emerged as a platform for exotic correlated topological phases, including ferromagnetism and a non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator. Here we reveal the unexpected emergence of an intervalley superconducting phase that intervenes between these two states in the half-filled second moir\'{e} bands. Using a continuum model and exact diagonalization, we identify superconductivity through multiple signatures: negative binding energy, a dominant pair-density eigenvalue, finite superfluid stiffness, and pairing symmetry consistent with a time-reversal-symmetric nodal extended $s$-wave state. Remarkably, our numerical calculation suggests a continuous transition between superconductivity and the non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator, in which topology and symmetry evolve simultaneously, supported by an effective field-theory description. Our results establish higher moir\'{e} bands as fertile ground for intertwined superconductivity and topological order, and point to experimentally accessible routes for realizing superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We discover two intertwined $s_{\pm}-$ wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins. We show that when the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is under-doped, electron pairing associated to Hund's coupling $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ hole-doping $\delta_z$ increases, a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on the $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two primary pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures $T_c$, and evolve from one to the other following a smooth $T_c$ versus $\delta_z$ relation. A stark particle-hole asymmetry is observed in the superconducting phase diagram, indicating the crucial role played by the $\gamma-$ band of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. Our results present a picture unifying the two possible pairing mechanisms in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ superconductors. We discuss the implications of our findings to recent experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Inductive Bias and Spectral Properties of Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24914v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Efficient Sampling of Three-Dimensional Spin Glasses and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23945v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |
| **[Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model in a Quantum Glassy Landscape](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22977v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 Figures including Appendices</p></details> |
| **[Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19006v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional crossover in quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions.

We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

| **[Magnetoelectric Switching of Competing Magnetic Orders in Rhombohedral Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24672v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

| **[General Framework for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Interlayer Coupling and Far-Field Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23952v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moir\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.</p></details> |  |

Central to our scheme is the concept of ``quantum geometric discrepancy'' (QGD) that measures differences in the quantum geometry of paired electrons and drives the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a quantum geometric quantity known as ``anomalous quantum distance'', which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pairing susceptibility. Furthermore, we perform mean-field numerical simulations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition, which aligns well with our analytical results. Our work demonstrates that QGD offers a general and distinctive mechanism for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures plus supplementary information</p></details> |

Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto 1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states, which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

The combined presence of pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure, and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to novel topological phenomena.</p></details> | 23 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Electronic bounds in magnetic crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16121v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a systematic study of bound relations between different electronic properties of magnetic crystals: electron density, effective mass, orbital magnetization, localization length, Chern invariant, and electric susceptibility. All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands, while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three (Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.</p></details> |  |

We used on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions obtained from a newly developed first-principles calculation method. Our calculations for systems up to eight layers give rise to electron-hole asymmetries, band flatness, band gaps, and layer anti-ferromagnetic ground states in keeping with available experiments. By including the intersite Hubbard interactions up to the next-nearest neighboring sites, the band gaps are shown to open when the number of layers is larger than three, while the trilayer system maintains its metallic nature with two low energy density of state peaks near the Fermi energy whose separation increases with the range of inter-site Hubbard parameters. Within our framework, the calculated band gaps reflect mean-field ground states with extended Hubbard interactions, in closer agreement with experimental estimates. The tight-binding formulation further enables efficient treatment of large rhombohedral chiral systems, including twisted multilayer graphene.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals, this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version and comments are welcome</p></details> |

Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07062v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>7+10 ...</summary><p>7+10 pages, 4+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties of the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01048v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decades, magnetic frustration has been under intense debate due to its unusual properties. For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength. Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the kagome lattice.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin liquid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18845v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moir√© Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures. Supplementary material: 4 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 24 figures.

We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures. v5 Added co-author and predictions for electronic spectrum above the Fermi energy</p></details> |

We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.</p></details> |  |
