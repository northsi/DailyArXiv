| **[Superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates: itinerant perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20288v2)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(π/2, π/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(π, π)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, plus supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Minimal Time Robust Control for Two Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08056v4)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F > 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F > 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F > 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Supplementary 1 page</p></details> |
| **[Pressure-induced reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22999v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misfit layered compounds are natural van der Waals heterostructures in which electronically active transition-metal dichalcogenide layers are decoupled by incommensurate blocking layers, enabling bulk realization of quasi-two-dimensional quantum states. Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.</p></details> | 12 pages,4 figures |
| **[Surface-localized topological superconductivity in nodal-loop materials: BdG analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22837v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Hourglass Dirac chains enable intrinsic topological superconductivity in nonsymmorphic silicides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22793v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetries provide a robust route to symmetry-protected electronic topology, yet their role in stabilizing intrinsic topological superconductivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report \ch{TaPtSi} as a new member of the superconducting nonsymmorphic silicide family, characterized via AC transport, magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) measurements. Zero field $μ$SR reveals spontaneous internal magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$, establishing time reversal symmetry breaking in \ch{TaPtSi}. First principles calculations on \ch{TaPtSi} and its isostructural nonsymmorphic superconducting analogues reveal the presence of symmetry-protected hourglass dispersions. The "necks" of these dispersions form Dirac nodal rings and chains that reside near or intersect the Fermi level. Guided by Ginzburg Landau symmetry analysis, we identify an internally antisymmetric non unitary triplet pairing state as the unique ground state consistent with the experimental phenomenology. Based on Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations, we further demonstrate that this state supports Majorana surface modes, establishing its intrinsically topological nature. These results reveal a systematic route by which nonsymmorphic symmetry drives the interplay between hourglass Dirac chain topology and unconventional triplet pairing, positioning equiatomic silicides as a unified materials platform for intrinsic topological superconductivity.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Few-Layer NbSe2 in Superconducting Fluctuation Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22788v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory-Dominated Quantum Criticality as a Universal Route to High-Temperature Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22626v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22448v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$. Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state. To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Arrested Relaxation in a Disorder-Free Coulomb Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23362v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures + Supplementary Material (2 pages)</p></details> |

Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $α$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $α$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.</p></details> | <details><summary>20+9 ...</summary><p>20+9 pages (single-column formatting), 5+3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mott Intermittency at the Metal-Insulator Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22093v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resistivity maximum at a temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$ is a recurring feature of bandwidth-tuned Mott systems, yet its meaning remains controversial: is it a coherence-incoherence crossover of an electronically homogeneous metal, or does it mark the onset of transport through a mixed landscape of metallic and insulating regions? Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic "current-controlling" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\sim T_{\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures + Suppl.

| **[Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02663v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ansätze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework -- previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions -- to systematically explore the $J_1$-$J_2$ phase diagram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a $4 \times 4$ lattice. Through dense parameter scans of $J_2/J_1 \in [0.3, 0.7]$ with step size 0.01 and comprehensive latent space analysis, we investigate the nature of the intermediate regime using unsupervised order parameter discovery and critical point detection via multiple independent methods. This work demonstrates the application of rigorously validated machine learning methods to open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism, where traditional order parameter identification is challenged by competing interactions and limited accessible system sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11827v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work, the two-dimensional kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x<0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in magnetic samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet (AFM), with an unusually wide regime of short-ranged order, and propose theoretical models to explain this behavior. First, we show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM canting from antichiral AFM. Second, we propose a phenomenological model of weakly-FM-canted spin clusters to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in an ABH toy model to show how ABH disorder can stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures. v2: Sections reorganized for clarity.

| **[Probing frustrated spin systems with impurities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21086v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the effective interaction between two localized spin impurities embedded in a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Treating the impurity spins as classical moments coupled locally to the host, we combine second--order perturbation theory with large--scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to determine the impurity--impurity interaction as a function of separation, coupling strength, and magnetic frustration. In the weak--coupling regime, we show that the interaction is governed by the the static spin susceptibility of the host and exhibits oscillatory power--law decay in the gapless phase, modified by universal logarithmic corrections at the SU(2)--symmetric critical point. In the gapped dimerized phase, the interaction decays exponentially with distance. For intermediate and strong impurity--host coupling, we observe a crossover to a boundary--dominated regime characterized by pronounced parity effects associated with the length of the chain segment between impurities, signaling a breakdown of the simple RKKY--like description. Our results establish impurity--impurity interactions as a sensitive probe of frustrated quantum spin liquids and provide a controlled framework for distinguishing gapless and gapped phases through local perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298v5)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_τ V_s)$, where $N_τ$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_τV_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_τ\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+5 ...</summary><p>13+5 pages, 6+6 figures</p></details> |

We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+12 ...</summary><p>5+12 pages, 6+8 figures</p></details> |

Near-minima of random functions also play an important role in high-dimensional statistics and statistical learning, where minimizing the empirical risk (which is a random function of the model parameters) is the method of choice for learning a statistical model from noisy data. Finally, near-minima of random functions are obviously central to average-case analysis of optimization algorithms. Computer science, statistics, and machine learning naturally lead to questions that are traditionally not addressed within physics and mathematical physics.

For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model. Our results motivate further investigations of the relatively unexplored topic of correlations in disorder in spin glasses and related problems.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster updates, parallel tempering, and three replica cluster moves for spin glasses: the Houdayer isoenergetic cluster move, the Jorg stochastic variant, and the Chayes-Machta-Redner (CMR) blue-bond algorithm. Overlap statistics between replica pairs enable computation of the spin glass order parameter and Binder ratio. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperatures of the two-dimensional Ising model on the square and triangular lattices via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.</p></details> |  |

We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy gap of quantum spin glasses: a projection quantum Monte Carlo study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20108v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization is fundamentally limited by the minimum energy gap $Δ$ encountered at quantum phase transitions. We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus additional material</p></details> |
| **[Overlap locking and non-perturbative effects in spin glasses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18399v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the phenomenon of the locking of the order parameter (or synchronization) in spin glasses at low temperatures. When two systems with independent disorders are coupled, their overlaps become similar. A crucial question is how this effect depends on the strength of the coupling between the two systems. Non-perturbative phenomena are present when $1 \ll ΔH \ll N$, being $ΔH$ the coupling Hamiltonian and $N$ the size of the system. In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to PNAS</p></details> |
| **[Long-range spin glass in a field at zero temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03488v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compute the critical exponents of the zero-temperature spin glass transition in a field on a one-dimensional long-range model, a proxy for higher-dimensional systems. Our approach is based on a novel loop expansion within the Bethe $M$-layer formalism, whose adaptation to this specific case is detailed here. The resulting estimates provide crucial benchmarks for numerical simulations that can access larger system sizes in one dimension, thus offering a key test of the theory of spin glasses in a field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06386v5)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</p></details> |  |
