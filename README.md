| **[Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13601v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 main figures, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13367v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing ground-state degeneracies of a strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model with superconducting correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13242v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 Main text figures, 9 Supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17762v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p></details> |  |

We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+3 ...</summary><p>10+3 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

| **[Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01513v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12570v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[2$k_F$ instability and chiral spin density wave at the 1/9 magnetization plateau in the kagome antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11670v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17144v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 14 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary Material: 12 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18250v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+9 ...</summary><p>10+9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 16 pages supplemental material</p></details> |

However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $KΓΓ'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5+1 figures</p></details> |

Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p></details> |  |

In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $π$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $π$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra.

| **[Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.</p></details> |  |

Our resistivity and heat capacity measurements indicate that YRu$_3$B$_2$ is a weakly coupled superconductor, with critical temperature $T_c$ = 0.63 K and upper critical field $μ_0 H_{c2}$ (0)=0.11 T. Density functional theory calculations, together with chemical-bonding analysis, reveal that the electronic states at and near the Fermi energy level are dominated by the Ru kagome sublattice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static and dynamic properties of the frustrated spin-1/2 depleted-kagome antiferromagnet Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03546v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structural and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ depleted-kagome compound Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ are investigated using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

| **[Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
