| **[Signatures of Dynes superconductivity in the THz response of ALD-grown NbN thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15003v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The frequency-dependent complex optical conductivity reflects key properties of superconductors, such as the energy gap in the density of states (DOS) and the superfluid density. For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radio-Frequency Gasket for Studies of Superconductivity in Diamond Anvil Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14807v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents the development and testing of a novel radio-frequency (RF) gasket with a Lenz lens surface geometry for contactless measurements in diamond anvil cells (DACs). Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A scalable non-superconducting tunnel junction technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14637v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tunnel junctions are one of the key elements of chip-scale microsystems serving various technologies from classical microelectronics to quantum information. Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures; equal contribution of J.L., K.R., O.S.S, and R.P.L</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting Gap Structures in Wallpaper Fermion Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25823v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the Mackey--Bradley theorem.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, proceedings of LT30</p></details> |
| **[Reentrant Superconductivity in Zeeman Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14507v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a theoretical model for a superconductor that exhibits the reentrant superconductivity in Zeeman fields. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian includes three vectors in spin space: a $d$ vector of a spin-triplet superconducting state, a potential representing spin-orbit interactions, and a Zeeman field. When the three vectors are perpendicular to one another, the spin-orbit interaction suppresses superconductivity in weak Zeeman fields and enhances superconductivity in strong Zeeman fields. The instability (stability) of superconducting state is characterized by the appearance of odd-frequency (even-frequency) Cooper pairs.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Reversible tuning of magnetic order and intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films via stoichiometry control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14398v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.</p></details> | 5 figures,1 table |
| **[Pattern recognition with superconducting wirelet neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14330v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic computing aims to reproduce the energy efficiency and adaptability of biological intelligence in hardware. Superconducting devices are an attractive platform due to their ultra-low dissipation and fast switching dynamics. Here we introduce a shunted superconducting wirelet as an artificial neuron, representing the simplest possible superconducting neuron implementation. This minimal design, a single superconducting channel with a resistive shunt, enables straightforward fabrication, electronic control, and high scalability. The neuron exhibits spiking voltage behavior driven by the interplay of resistive switching and relaxation, with key properties such as threshold, firing frequency, and refractory time tunable via applied current, temperature, and shunt resistance. We further show that the resulting temporal voltage signals can be incorporated into a training algorithm to achieve accurate pattern recognition, demonstrating suitability for neuromorphic tasks. Finally, we discuss on-chip training using similar wirelets with gated synaptic weights, establishing a scalable, energy-efficient building block for cryogenic artificial intelligence hardware, integrable with other emergent superconducting technologies.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07196v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 2 appendices</p></details> |

| **[Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15020v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Competing states in the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model: a dynamical density-matrix renormalization group study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14892v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5+9...</summary><p>5+5+9 pages, 3+3+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14769v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13192v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 8...</summary><p>8 + 8 pages, 3 + 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12990v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 36 figures.

| **[Footprints of the Kitaev spin liquid in the Fano lineshapes of the Raman active optical phonons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08878v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theoretical description of the Raman spectroscopy in the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev system and show that it can provide intriguing observable signatures of fractionalized excitations characteristic of the underlying spin liquid phase. In particular, we obtain the explicit form of the phonon modes and construct the coupling Hamiltonians based on $D_{3d}$ symmetry. We then systematically compute the Raman intensity and show that the spin-phonon coupling renormalizes phonon propagators and generates the salient Fano linshape. We find that the temperature evolution of the Fano lineshape displays two crossovers, and the low temperature crossover shows pronounced magnetic field dependence. We thus identify the observable effect of the Majorana fermions and the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes encoded in the Fano lineshape. Our results explain several phonon Raman scattering experiments in the candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entangled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled quantum paramagnetic phases in the phase diagram, which in the absence of the magnetic field previously was predicted for more complex type of interaction. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.</p></details> |  |

We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures; Discussion and figure added</p></details> |

Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text: 14 pages, 7 figures. supplement: 1 page, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Nature Physics</p></details> |
| **[Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in Kagome metals near van Hove singularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05234v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently-discovered family of Kagome metals has attracted significant interest due to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic loop-current bond order (NLCBO) that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Examining an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point, we find that frustration of the complex order-parameter phases leads to NLCBO. We further present conditions for overcoming other competing phases, including isotropic charge-bond and loop-current orders. Applying our findings to a previously studied model for $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$, we find that NLCBO emerges within a small region of phase space within mean-field theory. Our theory provides a microscopic description that goes beyond symmetry-allowed free-energy analyses and is broadly applicable to other Kagome metals featuring van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropy, frustration and saddle point in the twisted Kagome antiferromagnet ErPdPb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08900v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</p></details> |  |

Our comprehensive study employs three approaches: the level-spectroscopy method, Monte Carlo simulations, and a machine-learning phase classification technique. In this system, we observe two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. We present a phase diagram consisting of three phases: the low-temperature ordered phase with sublattice magnetizations, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase, as a function of the ratio of the NNN interaction to the NN interaction. We verify the six-state clock universality through the machine-learning study, which uses data from the six-state clock model on the kagome lattice for training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Topological superconductivity on a kagome magnet coupled to a Rashba superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07383v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
