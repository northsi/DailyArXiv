| **[Semiclassical theory for the orbital magnetic moment of superconducting quasiparticles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17376v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $θ$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $Σ$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[High-temperature $η$-pairing superconductivity in the photodoped Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17238v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $η$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15998v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17000v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $α$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\llξ_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\ggξ_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $α_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Coexisting electronic smectic liquid crystal and superconductivity in a Si square-net semimetal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10939v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[3D Unconventional Superconductivity in Bulk LaO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16783v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lanthanum-based compounds are cornerstones of superconductivity research, yet the La-5d orbitals typically remain empty spectator states far above the Fermi level (EF). While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing. This work clarifies the intrinsic superconductivity of bulk LaO and provides a foundation for designing new rare-earth-based superconductors with higher TC</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 14 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+7...</summary><p>4.5+7 pages, 4+4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Current Induced Switching of Superconducting Order and Enhancement of Superconducting Diode Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16648v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</p></details> | 14 Pages, 8 Figures |

| **[Majorana Signatures in Planar Tunneling through a Kitaev Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15020v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5+9...</summary><p>5+5+9 pages, 3+3+9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Variational preparation and characterization of chiral spin liquids in quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14769v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13192v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 8...</summary><p>8 + 8 pages, 3 + 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12990v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 36 figures.

In particular, we obtain the explicit form of the phonon modes and construct the coupling Hamiltonians based on $D_{3d}$ symmetry. We then systematically compute the Raman intensity and show that the spin-phonon coupling renormalizes phonon propagators and generates the salient Fano linshape. We find that the temperature evolution of the Fano lineshape displays two crossovers, and the low temperature crossover shows pronounced magnetic field dependence. We thus identify the observable effect of the Majorana fermions and the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes encoded in the Fano lineshape. Our results explain several phonon Raman scattering experiments in the candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entangled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled quantum paramagnetic phases in the phase diagram, which in the absence of the magnetic field previously was predicted for more complex type of interaction. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16665v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18963v3)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and therefore difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica methods in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce replica Markov processes, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of the dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions. Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the Rényi and Tsallis entropies, where the bounds involve the initial dynamical activity. Analogous bounds can be derived for the entropies of the state distribution. In particular, we provide upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy of state distributions. Moreover, we show that the Rényi and Tsallis entropies of the state distribution are bounded from above by terms involving the local escape rate from the initial node. We also illustrate how replicas can be used to study other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12595v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages.

Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (including Supplemental Material), 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated some references, and added the doi to the data repository</p></details> |
| **[Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</p></details> |  |
