| **[Quantum Geometry Induced Kekulé Superconductivity in Haldane phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21791v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21213v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regimes, enabling the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting and flux-dependent spectral linewidths. In a two-qubit device consisting of a SQUID and a single junction, power-dependent measurements reveal a two-stage dispersive shift. By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21199v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Distinct Suppression Mechanisms of Superconductivity by Magnetic Domains and Spin Fluctuations in EuFe2(As1-xPx)2 superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20364v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence for Clean d-wave Superconductivity in Samarium Nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20928v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tutorial on Superconducting Quantum Circuits: From Basics to Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20913v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Drastic field-induced resistivity upturns as signatures of unconventional magnetism in superconducting iron chalcogenides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20862v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic scattering is a powerful tool to identify underlying changes in electronic behavior and incipient electronic and magnetic orders. The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Substrate and cation engineering for optimizing superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20529v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nontrivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a nontrivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</p></details> | published version |

| **[Obstructed Cooper Pairs in Line-Graph Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17815v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doping a Mott insulator is widely expected to produce mobile Cooper pairs whose kinetic energy sets the superfluid stiffness. Here we demonstrate a striking counterexample. We show that when doped charges propagate on the line-graph of a lattice with strong pairing interaction, they bind into obstructed Cooper pairs whose motion is frustrated by destructive interference. As a result, the leading-order pair kinetic energy vanishes identically in the strong-coupling expansion, producing a flat bosonic band of compact localised pair states and a vanishing superfluid stiffness at leading order. The low-energy Hilbert space is dominated by these localised pairs, yielding an extensively degenerate ground-state manifold and a superfluid stiffness that vanishes anomalously as the third inverse power of the pairing strength. At quarter filling, the frustrated pair dynamics maps onto a quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, realizing a d-wave resonating-valence-bond spin liquid with topological ground-state degeneracy and deconfined holon excitations. Our results establish a disorder-free mechanism for interaction-driven localization, in which strong pairing collapses the kinetic energy of Cooper pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision, connections between strong-coupling superconductivity and frustrated magnetism, new mapping to quantum dimer model at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point with exact d-wave spin-liquid ground state, vanishing superfluid stiffness grounded in explicit calculation of strong-pairing stiffness, extensive many-body ground state degeneracies evaluated with exact diagonalization, and 9 new figures</p></details> |
| **[Competing magnetic and topological orders in the spin-1 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain with single-ion anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20912v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev--Heisenberg chain in the presence of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy (SIA) $D_z$ by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $φ$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Simulating fermionic fractional Chern insulators with infinite projected entangled-pair states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20697v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>the f...</summary><p>the first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Emergence of quantum spin liquid and spin-flop phase in Kitaev antiferromagnets in a [111] magnetic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04141v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$Γ$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $Γ$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Unveiling the Phase Diagram and Nonlinear Optical Responses of a Twisted Kitaev Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20209v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .</p></details> |  |
| **[Preparation of a Quantum Spin Liquid in Non-Hermitian Quantum Dimer Models and Rydberg Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19809v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>7.5+5...</summary><p>7.5+5 pages, 3+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fractionalized Fermi liquids and cuprate phase diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164v5)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in spin density wave theory. Magnetotransport measurements, including observation of the Yamaji angle, show clear evidence of hole pocket quasiparticles which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and are consistent with the FL* description. The FL* phase of a single-band model is described using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid (FL) at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of the FL*-FL metal-metal transition without a symmetry-breaking order parameter, using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to two spatial dimensions. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</p></details> | <details><summary>97 pa...</summary><p>97 pages, 43 figures.

| **[Dynamical Spectral Function of the Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18831v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids in Weak Mott Insulators with a Spin-Orbit Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05806v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The weak Mott insulating regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model exhibits a rich magnetic phase diagram as a result of the ring exchange interaction in the spin Hamiltonian. These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction. We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Recently discovered layered kagome compound Nb3Cl8 has been proposed as a Mott insulator coming from the half-filled flat band. Here we have carried out systematic transport study to uncover the evidence of Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8 thin flakes. Bipolar semiconducting property with Fermi level close to conduction band has been revealed. We have further probed the chemical potential of Nb3Cl8 by tracing the charge neutrality point of the monolayer graphene proximate to Nb3Cl8. The gap of Nb3Cl8 flakes is approximately 1.10 eV at 100 K and shows pronounced temperature dependence, decreasing substantially with increasing temperature to ~0.63 eV at 300 K. The melting behavior of the gapped state is in consistent with theoretically proposed Mott insulator in Nb3Cl8. Our work has demonstrated Nb3Cl8 as a promising platform to study strongly correlated physics at relatively high temperature.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4figures |

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.</p></details> |  |

We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level.

We establish a 2-to-1 correspondence between the configurations of trimers on the kagome lattice to the covering by dimers of a related hexagonal lattice to show that entropy of coverings per trimer $s_{\text{tri,kag}}$ equals the entropy per dimer $ s_{\text{dim,hex}} $, and is given by $ s_{\text{tri,kag}} = s_{\text{dim,hex}} = \frac{1}{2 π} \int_0^{ 2 π/3} \log( 2 + 2 \cos k) dk \approx 0.323065947\ldots$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Single Ion Anisotropy of $Ln^{3+}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho) Controls Magnetic Excitations in $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ Ferrimagnetic Kagome Metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17715v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ family of materials, where $Ln^{3+}$ is a lanthanide trivalent cation, have attracted extensive interest due to the interplay of electronic structure, magnetism, and topology present in this family that gives rise to complex electronic and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages main text, 41 total including supplementary info, 4 main figures, 40 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $Ω^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. Our calculations reveal a transition from a topological semimetal to a trivial metallic phase at an electric field strength of $\approx$0.40 eV/Å. These findings position 2D ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ as a promising candidate for applications in modern electronic devices, with its tunable topological phases offering the potential for future innovations in quantum computing and material design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving the field-free Josephson diode effect using Kagome Mott insulator barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17099v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages main text (15 pages in total), 4 main text figures (9 figures total)</p></details> |

We report a comprehensive first-principles study of Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ kagome bilayers, examining four stacking configurations (AA, AA$'$, AB, AB$'$). Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics. Carrier effective masses show significant stacking dependence, ranging from 2.39-6.35~$m_0$ for electrons and 0.67-1.55~$m_0$ for holes. Strain engineering of the AB$'$ bilayer demonstrates non-monotonic band gap tuning and asymmetric modulation of carrier masses, with hole effective masses showing stronger strain sensitivity. These results establish Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform for strain-engineered kagome-based quantum devices, where stacking order and mechanical deformation provide complementary control over electronic transport.</p></details> |  |
