| **[Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06814v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed; Anderson's RVB picture (Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987) and U(1) gauge theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996) motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism (Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022) yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). Since orthorhombic tilts are not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; Nature 621, 493, 2023), we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers - ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates - intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the microscopic origin remains open, we outline possible scenarios, and our real-space construction maps directly onto lattice models, placing superconductivity and Hubbard physics on the same footing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of spin excitations in superconducting La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-Î´}$ from the underdoped to the heavily overdoped regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06680v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate high-energy spin excitations in hole-doped La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ films across a broad Ca doping range $x = 0.05-0.50$ using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.</p></details> | 6 figures |
| **[AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs Mode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13074v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear planar Hall effect from superconducting vortex motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06313v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the nonreciprocal charge transport along the longitudinal and transverse directions in the vortex flow regime of FeSe superconducting films. Clear nonreciprocal signals under an inplane magnetic field reveals symmetry breaking at the film surfaces since the crystal structure of FeSe is centrosymmetric. Although the symmetry in such polar superconductors allows the nonreciprocal transverse response under a magnetic field parallel to the electric current, its observation is physically counterintuitive because vortex motion is not expected in this configuration. We propose that thermally excited (anti)vortices due to the two-dimensional nature of FeSe give rise to the nonreciprocal transverse signals when the mirror symmetry is broken by the inplane magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, and ancillary files including 2 gif animations and 5 Mathematica notebooks; the reference to dataset is added in v2; references to repository added, minor typos fixed, class file changed in v3</p></details> |
| **[Estimated scale of Born rule violation in superconducting qubit measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04733v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I estimate the size of expected Born rule violation for a two-level superconducting qubit with dispersive readout. The estimate is based on extrapolating from an earlier analysis of experimental data on cloud chamber detection. That analysis made no explicit use of quantum measurement axioms and found indication that the Born rule breaks down when it would otherwise naively predict extremely small measurement probabilities. In such cases, the Born rule significantly over-predicts the number of measurement events. The level of breakdown that I estimate here for the two-level qubit may be too small to have a meaningful impact on practical quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated references, clarified some language</p></details> |
| **[A Strongly Anisotropic Superconducting Gap in the Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$: A Study of Directional Point-Contact Andreev Reflection Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06066v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the recently discovered V-based kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order, raising a fundamental concern on the superconducting gap structure of such kagome superconductors in the presence of CDW orders. Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR) spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\ sim$70\% with a gap minimum of about 0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing states in kagome superconductors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust cross-chain surface interstitial electronic states and doping-enhanced superconductivity in monolayer $M_2$N ($M$= Ti, Zr, Hf) electrides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19263v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of electrides holds great promise for advancing both fundamental physics and chemistry, owing to their unique characteristics arising from loosely bound interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a class of cross-chain electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. Notably, the cross-chain electride characteristic in the $M_2$N monoalyers is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced and robust surface interstitial electronic state. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering another pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Pressure Induced 18 K Superconductivity and Two Superconducting Phases in CuIr2S4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04407v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report pressure-induced superconductivity in the spinel CuIr2S4 with a transition temperature Tc reaching 18.2 K, establishing a new record for this class of materials and surpassing the decades-old limit of 13.7 K. Our electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies up to 224 GPa reveal the emergence of \textbf{two distinct superconducting phases} from a charge-ordered insulating state. The first phase (SC-I) appears around 18 GPa, forming a superconducting dome that peaks at 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Above 111.8 GPa, a second, lower-Tc phase (SC-II) emerges and coexists with SC-I over a broad pressure range. These superconducting phases are intimately linked to a cascade of structural transitions that systematically distort the frustrated pyrochlore lattice of Ir atoms. Our results redefine the potential for superconductivity in spinels and showcase a pathway to high-Tc pairing directly from a correlated insulating state driven by lattice tuning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</p></details> | 29 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03022v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical aging is one of the non-equilibrium phenomena where physical properties change over time due to structural relaxation. Aging in spin glass systems has been explained by a trap model on the temperature-independent energy landscape. Meanwhile, in the free energy landscape (FEL) approach to aging phenomena, it is assumed that the FEL responds to temperature changes with a time delay. In this paper, aging in a glass forming model in which both the trapping effect and the delayed response of the FEL exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript |
| **[Efficient strategy for Parallel Minority Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02770v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the parallel Minority Game, where a group of agents, each having two choices, try to independently decide on a strategy such that they stay on minority between their own two choices. However, there are multiple such groups of agents, and some of them have common choices. This overlap brings in additional competition among the agents making the variance reduction a complex optimization problem. We study multiple stochastic strategies and find that the most efficient strategy is the one where the agents have just the memory of their last visit to the their alternative choice. The resulting dynamics, even though giving the lowest population variance among the strategies studied here, end up in a frozen state. However, the frozen state does not bring the the variance to its lowest possible value; a situation qualitatively analogous to spin-glass systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14105v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</p></details> | 36 pages |

As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Scaling of the Electrical Conductivity Spectra Reveals Distinct Transport Responses in A2SmTaO6 [A = Ba, Sr, Ca]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21621v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disorder plays an important role in materials science, influencing material behavior across different length scales. Imperfections like vacancies, atomic substitutions, lattice distortions, and microstructural inhomogeneities, disrupt ideal periodicity thereby altering physical properties. Analogous to spin-glass systems, electrical 'glassiness' arises when charge carriers confront disordered energy landscapes, leading to a broad range of relaxation times, especially in polycrystalline materials where dipoles experience competing exchange interactions. Complex impedance, permittivity, and electric modulus distill out separate resistive and capacitive effects, offering insights into how microstructural inhomogeneities affects conduction mechanism. In polycrystalline double perovskites A2SmTaO6 (A = Ba, Ca), with a power law driven ac conductivity, the hopping and relaxation of carriers is affected by both grains and grain boundaries. Scaling of ac conductivity and impedance response reveals correlation between conduction and relaxation timescales. The inhomogeneities in local energy landscape of 'frustrated' dipoles restrict the 'universality' of conduction mechanism across the bulk length scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20724v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+4...</summary><p>4.5+4.5 pages, 2+2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Non-classical optimization of entangled photons through complex media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24283v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Symmetry-enforced MoirÃ© Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06906v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</p></details> | 43 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03039v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 + ...</summary><p>12 + 6 pages, 4 + 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05958v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 3+1 figures.

| **[Exact models of chiral flat-band superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21127v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation-driven 3d Heavy Fermion behavior in LiV2O4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05237v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiV2O4 is a spinel-structured compound that stands out as the first known 3d-electron system exhibiting typical heavy fermion behavior. A central question is how such strong mass renormalization emerges in the absence of f-electrons. In this work, we investigate the three-dimensional electronic structure of LiV2O4 thin films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify that an electron-like flat band is derived from a1g orbitals, along with a highly dispersive e'g band strongly coupled with phonons. The overall agreement with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations highlights the essential role of inter-orbital Hund's coupling in reducing the a1g bandwidth to 25 meV, approaching a Mott state. Notably, we find that heavy-fermion behavior arises from additional renormalization at the a1g band near the Fermi level, likely driven by many-body interactions at energy scales down to a few meV and potentially linked to geometric frustration inherent to the spinel lattice. These results provide crucial insights into the origin of the heavy fermion behavior in 3d-electron systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coexisting Kagome and Heavy Fermion Flat Bands in YbCr$_6$Ge$_6$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04902v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat bands, emergent in strongly correlated electron systems, stand at the frontier of condensed matter physics, providing fertile ground for unconventional quantum phases. Recent observations of dispersionless bands at the Fermi level in kagome lattice open the possibility of unifying the disjoint paradigms of topology and correlation-driven heavy fermion liquids. Here, we report the unprecedented coexistence of these mechanisms in the layered kagome metal YbCr6Ge6. At high temperatures, an intrinsic kagome flat band-arising from the frustrated hopping on the kagome lattice-dominates the Fermi level. Upon cooling, localized Yb 4f-states hybridize with the topological kagome flat bands, transforming this state into the Kondo resonance states that are nearly dispersionless across the entire Brillouin zone. Crystalline symmetry forbids hybridization along specific high-symmetry lines, which stabilizes Dirac crossings of heavy-fermion character. Topological analysis of the resulting gaps reveals both trivial and nontrivial Z2 invariants, establishing the emergence of a Dirac-Kondo semimetal phase. Taken together, these results identify YbCr6Ge6 as a prototype of a topological heavy-fermion system and a platform where geometric frustration, strong correlations, and topology converge, with broad implications for correlated quantum matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-dimensional Dirac semimetals with tunable edge states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03943v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We theoretically propose a design for two-dimensional Dirac semimetals using a bilayer-modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. By introducing new sites into the BHZ model, we engineer flat bands at the Fermi energy. In the bilayer system, interlayer coupling separates these flat bands, resulting in two Dirac points that preserve time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Two Dirac points are connected by a one-dimensional Fermi arc edge state, whose bound nature is confirmed by quantized transmission resonance peaks. Notably, the position of the Dirac points can be precisely tuned by adjusting interlayer coupling strengths and symmetries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of the pseudogap band structure in a system of electron-correlated lattice polarons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06018v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of the role of lattice vibrations in the formation of the pseudogap state in strongly correlated electron systems has been investigated concerning changes in the electron-phonon coupling parameters and the concentration of doped charge carriers. We apply the polaronic version of the generalized tight-binding method to analyze the band structure of a realistic multiband two-dimensional model that incorporates the electron-lattice contributions of both Holstein and Peierls types. It has been demonstrated that the emergence of polaronic effects begins with the modulation of spectral function intensity. However, within a specific region of the phase diagram, a significant transformation of the electron band structure and pseudogap state occurs. It results from coherent polaron excitations that create a partially flat band near the Fermi level. This process leads to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface and the emergence of corresponding features in the density of states.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03601v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states with an envelope wavefunction that has finite vorticity in momentum space, dictated by the topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin, which can have a net Chern number, and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, we find that topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
