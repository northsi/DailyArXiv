| **[Superconducting band stabilizing superconductivity in MgB2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1656v1)** | 2011-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is shown that the superconducting intermetallic compound MgB2 possesses a narrow, partly filled "superconducting band" with Wannier functions of special symmetry in its band structure. This result corroborates previous observations about the band structures of numerous superconductors and non-superconductors showing that evidently superconductivity is always connected with such superconducting bands. These findings are interpreted in the framework of a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model. Within this new group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow superconducting bands. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconducting band is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a conventional low-Tc or a high-Tc superconductor. This interpretation provides the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Journal of Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism</p></details> |
| **[Superconducting nanowire diode](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11935v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconducting diode with nonreciprocal transport effect underlies the cornerstone of contemporary integrated circuits (ICs) technology. Due to isotropic superconducting properties and the lack of breaking of inversion symmetry for conventional s-wave superconductors, such a superconducting peer is absent. Recently, a series of superconducting structures, including superconducting superlattice and quantum-material-based superconducting Josephson junction, have exhibited a superconducting diode effect in terms of polarity-dependent critical current. However, due to complex structures, these composite systems are not able to construct large-scale integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrated the minimal superconducting electric component-superconducting nanowire-based diode with a nonreciprocal transport effect under a perpendicular magnetic field, in which the superconducting to normal metallic phase transition relies on the polarity and amplitude of the bias current. Our nanowire diodes can be reliably operated nearly at all temperatures below the critical temperature, and the rectification efficiency at 2 K can be more than 24%. Moreover, the superconducting nanowire diode is able to rectify both square wave and sine wave signals without any distortion. Combining the superconducting nanowire-based diodes and transistors, superconducting nanowires hold the possibility to construct novel low-dissipation superconducting ICs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity in diamond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0404156v1)** | 2009-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped diamond synthesized at high pressure (8-9 GPa) and temperature (2,500-2,800 K). Electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and field-dependent resistance measurements show that boron-doped diamond is a bulk, type-II superconductor below the superconducting transition temperature Tc=4 K; superconductivity survives in a magnetic field up to Hc2(0)=3.5 T. The discovery of superconductivity in diamond-structured carbon suggests that Si and Ge, which also form in the diamond structure, may similarly exhibit superconductivity under the appropriate conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconductivity and Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9308018v3)** | 2008-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a review of theoretical and experimental works on the problem of mutual interplay of Anderson localization and superconductivity in strongly disordered systems. We start with brief discussion of modern aspects of localization theory including the basic concept of scaling, self-consistent theory and interaction effects. After that we analyze disorder effects on Cooper pairing and superconducting transition temperature as well as Ginzburg-Landau equations for superconductors which are close to the Anderson transition. A necessary generalization of usual theory of ``dirty'' superconductors is formulated which allows to analyze anomalies of the main superconducting properties close to disorder-induced metal-insulator transition. Under very rigid conditions superconductivity may persist even in the localized phase (Anderson insulator).Strong disordering leads to considerable reduction of superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and to important anomalies in the behavior of the upper critical field H_{c2}. Fluctuation effects are also discussed. In the vicinity of Anderson transition inhomogeneous superconductivity appears due to statistical fluctuations of the local density of states. We briefly discuss a number of experiments demonstrating superconductivity close to the Anderson transition both in traditional and high-T_{c} superconductors. In traditional systems superconductivity is in most cases destroyed before metal-insulator transition. In case of high-T_{c} superconductors a number of anomalies show that superconductivity is apparently conserved in localized phase before it is suppressed by strong enough disorder.</p></details> | <details><summary>120 p...</summary><p>120 pages, 41 figures, RevTeX 3.0, Published in Physics Reports 282,No.5&6,225 (1997), figures added</p></details> |
| **[Room-Temperature Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0606187v1)** | 2010-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the first book on the subject of room-temperature superconductivity. The main purpose of the book is twofold. First, to show that, under suitable conditions, superconductivity can occur above room temperature. Secondly, to present general guidelines on how to synthesize a room temperature superconductor. The book begins with an introduction into the physics of the superconducting state and superconducting materials. The mechanisms of conventional, half-conventional and unconventional superconductivity are discussed in the following chapters. The last three chapters of the book are devoted to room temperature superconductivity. In Chapter 2, an attempt to review the basic properties of the superconducting state independently of any specific mechanism is made for the first time. In addition, four principles of superconductivity valid for any type of superconductivity are introduced in Chapter 4. The book is mainly addressed to specialists in materials science and in the field of superconductivity. At the same time, students will also benefit from reading the first nine chapters of the book.</p></details> | <details><summary>a boo...</summary><p>a book (326 pages, with 128 figures) published in 2004.

| **[Curvature-induced superconductivity enhancement for ultra-thin superconducting films](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14373v3)** | 2023-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive the linearized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation for an ultra-thin superconducting film with curvature in a magnetic field. By introducing a novel transverse order parameter that varies slowly along the film, and applying the superconducting/vacuum boundary condition, we decouple the linearized GL equation into a transverse part and a surface part that includes the superconducting geometric potential (GP). The nucleation of the superconducting state in curved thin superconducting films can be equivalently described by the surface part equation. In the equivalent GL free energy of a curved superconducting film, the superconducting GP enables the film to remain in the superconducting state even when the superconducting parameter $ α$ turns positive by further reducing the quadratic term of the order parameter. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the phase transition of a rectangle thin superconducting film bent around a cylindrical surface. Our numerical results show that the superconducting GP enhances the superconductivity of the curved film by weakening the effect of the magnetic field, and the increase of the critical temperature, in units of the bulk critical temperature, is equal to the product of the negative superconducting GP and the square of the zero-temperature coherence length, which agrees with our theoretical predictions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nodal superconductivity and superconducting domes in the topological Kagome metal CsV3Sb5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08356v2)** | 2021-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently superconductivity was discovered in the Kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), which has an ideal Kagome lattice of vanadium. These V-based superconductors also host charge density wave (CDW) and topological nontrivial band structure. Here we report the ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity and high pressure resistance measurements on CsV3Sb5 with Tc = 2.5 K, the highest among AV3Sb5. A finite residual linear term of thermal conductivity at zero magnetic field and its rapid increase in fields suggest nodal superconductivity. By applying pressure, the Tc of CsV3Sb5 increases first, then decreases to lower than 0.3 K at 11.4 GPa, showing a clear first superconducting dome peaked around 0.8 GPa. Above 11.4 GPa, superconductivity re-emerges, suggesting a second superconducting dome. Both nodal superconductivity and superconducting domes point to unconventional superconductivity in this V-based superconductor. While our finding of nodal superconductivity puts a strong constrain on the pairing state of the first dome, which should be related to the CDW instability, the superconductivity of the second dome may present another exotic pairing state in this ideal Kagome lattice of vanadium.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Spintronics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.00713v1)** | 2015-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional studies that combine spintronics and superconductivity have mainly focused on the injection of spin-polarized quasiparticles into superconducting materials. However, a complete synergy between superconducting and magnetic orders turns out to be possible through the creation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs, which are generated at carefully engineered superconductor interfaces with ferromagnetic materials. Currently, there is intense activity focused on identifying materials combinations that merge superconductivity and spintronics to enhance device functionality and performance. The results look promising: it has been shown, for example, that superconducting order can greatly enhance central effects in spintronics such as spin injection and magnetoresistance. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical advances in this field and provide an outlook for upcoming challenges in superconducting spintronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review article published in Nature Physics</p></details> |

Our reversible magnetization measurements demonstrate the absence of a bulk Meissner state in the compound below the superconducting transition temperature. Several scenarios that might account for the absence of a bulk Meissner state, including the possible presence of a sponge-like non-uniform superconducting or a crypto-superconducting structure in the chemically uniform Ru-1212, have been proposed and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 PNG figures, submitted to Proceedings of the 9th Japan-US Workshop on High-Tc Superconductors, Yamanashi, Japan, October 13-15, 1999; accepted for publication in Physica C (December 24, 1999)</p></details> |
| **[Anisotropic superconductivity induced at a hybrid superconducting-semiconducting interface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08498v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epitaxial semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures are promising as a platform for gate-tunable superconducting electronics. Thus far, the superconducting properties in such hybrid systems have been predicted based on simplified hybridization models which neglect the electronic structure that can arise at the interface. Here, we demonstrate that the hybrid electronic structure derived at the interface between semiconducting black phosphorus and atomically thin films of lead can drastically modify the superconducting properties of the thin metallic film. Using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we ascertain the moiré structure driven by the interface, and observe a strongly anisotropic renormalization of the superconducting gap and vortex structure of the lead film. Based on density functional theory, we attribute the renormalization of the superconductivity to weak hybridization at the interface where the anisotropic characteristics of the semiconductor band structure is imprinted on the Fermi surface of the superconductor. Based on a hybrid two-band model, we link this hybridization-driven renormalization to a weighting of the superconducting order parameter that quantitatively reproduces the measured spectra. These results illustrate the effect of interfacial hybridization at superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures, and pathways for engineering quantum technologies based on gate-tunable superconducting electronics.</p></details> |  |

We theoretically investigate the spin pumping from an insulating ferromagnet into spin glass materials. Combining a dynamic theory of spin glasses with the linear-response formulation of the spin pumping, we calculate temperature dependence of the spin pumping near the spin glass transition. The analysis predicts that a characteristic peak appears in the spin pumping signal, reflecting that the spin fluctuations slow down upon the onset of spin freezing.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Finite-size effects in the non-equilibrium relaxation are analyzed, and the relaxation functions of the spin-glass susceptibility and the chiral-glass susceptibility in the infinite-size system are obtained. The finite-time scaling analysis gives the spin-glass transition at $T_{\rm sg}/J=0.21_{-0.02}^{+0.01}$ and the chiral-glass transition at $T_{\rm cg}/J=0.22_{-0.03}^{+0.01}$. The results suggest that both transitions occur simultaneously. The critical exponent of the spin-glass susceptibility is estimated as $γ_{\rm sg}= 1.7 \pm 0.3$, which makes an agreement with the experiments of the insulating and the canonical spin-glass materials.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Between taps, zero temperature single spin flip dynamics takes the system to a metastable state. Tapping, corresponds to flipping simultaneously any spin with probability $p$. This dynamics leads to a stationary regime with a steady state energy $E(p)$. We analytically solve this dynamics for the one dimensional ferromagnet and $\pm J$ spin glass. Numerical simulations for spin glasses and ferromagnets of higher connectivity are carried out, in particular we find a novel first order transition for the ferromagnetic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, RevTeX</p></details> |

In anisotropic aerogel with stretching deformation two glass phases are observed. Both phases represent the anisotropic glass of the orbital ferromagnetic vector l -- the orbital glass (OG). The phases differ by the spin structure: the spin nematic vector d can be either in the ordered spin nematic (SN) state or in the disordered spin-glass (SG) state. The first phase (OG-SN) is formed under conventional cooling from normal 3He. The second phase (OG-SG) is metastable, being obtained by cooling through the superfluid transition temperature, when large enough resonant continuous radio-frequency excitation are applied. NMR signature of different phases allows us to measure the parameter of the global anisotropy of the orbital glass induced by deformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to Pis'ma v ZhETF (JETP Letters)</p></details> |

There is a single critical temperature, at which both a spin glass and a chiral glass orderings develop. The Monte Carlo algorithm, adapted from lattice gauge theory simulations, makes possible to thermalize lattices of size L=32, larger than in any previous spin glass simulation in three dimensions.

| **[Spin glass experiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00981v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A spin glass is a diluted magnetic material in which the magnetic moments are randomly interacting, with a huge number of metastable states which prevent reaching equilibrium. Spin-glass models are conceptually simple, but require very sophisticated treatments. These models have become a paradigm for the understanding of glassy materials and also for the solution of complex optimization problems. After cooling from the paramagnetic phase, the spin glass remains out of equilibrium, and slowly evolves. This aging phenomenon corresponds to the growth of a mysterious "spin-glass order", whose correlation length can be measured. A cooling temperature step during aging causes a partial "rejuvenation", while the "memory" of previous aging is stored and can be retrieved. Many glassy materials present aging, and rejuvenation and memory effects can be found in some cases, but they are usually less pronounced. Numerical simulations of these phenomena are presently under active development using custom-built supercomputers. A general understanding of the glassy systems, for which spin glasses bring a prominent insight, is still under construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as an article for the 2nd edition of the Elsevier Encyclopedia of Condensed Matter Physics, to appear in 2023. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1709.10293</p></details> |

| **[Singular flat bands](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04279v1)** | 2020-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review recent progresses in the study of flat band systems, especially focusing on the fundamental physics related to the singularity of the flat band's Bloch wave functions. We first explain that the flat bands can be classified into two classes: singular and nonsingular flat bands, based on the presence or absence of the singularity in the flat band's Bloch wave functions. The singularity is generated by the band crossing of the flat band with another dispersive band. In the singular flat band, one can find special kind of eigenmodes, called the non-contractible loop states and the robust boundary modes, which exhibit nontrivial real space topology. Then, we review the experimental realization of these topological eigenmodes of the flat band in the photonic lattices. While the singularity of the flat band is topologically trivial, we show that the maximum quantum distance around the singularity is a bulk invariant representing the strength of the singularity which protects the robust boundary modes. Finally, we discuss how the maximum quantum distance or the strength of the singularity manifests itself in the anomalous Landau level spreading of the singular flat band when it has a quadratic band-crossing with another band.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

Without the connectivity conditions on the flat band, the system is non-magnetic. We show that this is not always true. The reason is connected to a peculiar behavior of the band situated just above the flat band.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Flat bands with band crossings enforced by symmetry representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14919v2)** | 2021-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat bands have band crossing points with other dispersive bands in many systems including the canonical flat band models in the Lieb and kagome lattices. Here we show that some of such band degeneracy points are unavoidable because of the symmetry representation (SR) of the flat band under unitary symmetry. We refer to such a band degeneracy point of flat bands as a SR-enforced band crossing. SR-enforced band crossing is distinct from the conventional band degeneracy protected by symmetry eigenvalues or topological charges in that its protection requires both specific symmetry representation and band flatness of the flat band, simultaneously. Even $n$-fold rotation $C_n$ ($n=2,3,4,6$) symmetry, which cannot protect band degeneracy without additional symmetries due to its abelian nature, can protect SR-enforced band crossings in flat band systems. In two-dimensional flat band systems with $C_n$ symmetry, when the degeneracy of a SR-enforced band crossing is lifted by a $C_n$ symmetry-preserving perturbation, we obtain a nearly flat Chern band. Our theory not only explains the origin of the band crossing points of FBs existing in various models, but also gives a strict no-go theorem for isolated FBs in a given lattice arising from the SR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+14 ...</summary><p>8+14 pages, 4+6 figures, published version</p></details> |

In particular, we show how in the tunneling limit the critical Josephson current between flat-band superconductors is inversely proportional to the pair potential, how the quantum geometric contribution to the supercurrent contributes even in the normal state of a flat-band weak link, and how Andreev reflection is strongly affected by the presence of bound states. Our results are relevant for analyzing the superconducting properties of junctions involving electronic systems with flat bands.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Theoretical possibilities for flat-band superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04469v2)** | 2020-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One novel arena for designing superconductors with high $T_C$ is the flat-band systems. A basic idea is that flat bands, arising from quantum mechanical interference, give unique opportunities for enhancing $T_C$ with (i) many pair-scattering channels between the dispersive and flat bands, and (ii) an even more interesting situation when the flat band is topological and highly entangled. Here we compare two routes, which comprise a multi-band system with a flat band coexisting with dispersive ones, and a one-band case with a portion of the band being flat. Superconductivity can be induced in both cases when the flat band or portion is "incipient" (close to, but away from, the Fermi energy). Differences are, for the multi-band case, we can exploit large entanglement associated with topological states, while for the one-band case a transition between different (d and p) wave pairings can arise. These hint at some future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Proc. Int. Conf. "Superstripes 2019"</p></details> |

| **[Taming Flat Bands with Breathing Superlattices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04759v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.</p></details> | 23 pages,6 Figures |

| **[Spin liquids in graphene](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1700v2)** | 2015-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We reveal that local interactions in graphene allow novel spin liquids between the semi-metal and antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phases, identified with algebraic spin liquid and Z$_{2}$ spin liquid, respectively. We argue that the algebraic spin liquid can be regarded as the two dimensional realization of one dimensional spin dynamics, where antiferromagnetic correlations show exactly the same power-law dependence as valence bond correlations. Nature of the Z$_{2}$ spin liquid turns out to be $d + i d'$ singlet pairing, but time reversal symmetry is preserved, taking $d + i d'$ in one valley and $d - i d'$ in the other valley. We propose the quantized thermal valley Hall effect as an essential feature of this gapped spin liquid state. Quantum phase transitions among the semi-metal, algebraic spin liquid, and Z$_{2}$ spin liquid are shown to be continuous while the transition from the Z$_{2}$ spin liquid to the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator turns out to be the first order. We emphasize that both algebraic spin liquid and $d \pm id'$ Z$_{2}$ spin liquid can be verified by the quantum Monte Carlo simulation, showing the enhanced symmetry in the algebraic spin liquid and the quantized thermal valley Hall effect in the Z$_{2}$ spin liquid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classical spiral spin liquids as a possible route to quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11318v1)** | 2020-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids are long-range entangled phases whose magnetic correlations are determined by strong quantum fluctuations. While an overarching principle specifying the precise microscopic coupling scenarios for which quantum spin-liquid behavior arises is unknown, it is well-established that they are preferably found in spin systems where the corresponding classical limit of spin magnitudes $S\rightarrow\infty$ exhibits a macroscopic ground state degeneracy, so-called classical spin liquids. Spiral spin liquids represent a special family of classical spin liquids where degenerate manifolds of spin spirals form closed contours or surfaces in momentum space. Here, we investigate the potential of spiral spin liquids to evoke quantum spin-liquid behavior when the spin magnitude is tuned from the classical $S\rightarrow\infty$ limit to the quantum $S=1/2$ case. To this end, we first use the Luttinger-Tisza method to formulate a general scheme which allows one to construct new spiral spin liquids based on bipartite lattices. We apply this approach to the two-dimensional square lattice and the three-dimensional hcp lattice to design classical spiral spin-liquid phases which have not been previously studied. By employing the pseudofermion functional renormalization group (PFFRG) technique we investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations when the classical spins are replaced by quantum $S=1/2$ spins. We indeed find that extended spiral spin-liquid regimes change into paramagnetic quantum phases possibly realizing quantum spin liquids. Remnants of the degenerate spiral surfaces are still discernible in the momentum-resolved susceptibility, even in the quantum $S=1/2$ case. In total, this corroborates the potential of classical spiral spin liquids to induce more complex non-magnetic quantum phases.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.03742v1)** | 2017-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids may be considered "quantum disordered" ground states of spin systems, in which zero point fluctuations are so strong that they prevent conventional magnetic long range order. More interestingly, quantum spin liquids are prototypical examples of ground states with massive many-body entanglement, of a degree sufficient to render these states distinct phases of matter. Their highly entangled nature imbues quantum spin liquids with unique physical aspects, such as non-local excitations, topological properties, and more. In this review, we discuss the nature of such phases and their properties based on paradigmatic models and general arguments, and introduce theoretical technology such as gauge theory and partons that are conveniently used in the study of quantum spin liquids. An overview is given of the different types of quantum spin liquids and the models and theories used to describe them. We also provide a guide to the current status of experiments to study quantum spin liquids, and to the diverse probes used therein.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

In the chiral spin liquids, exact stable ground states with spontaneous breaking of the time reversal symmetry are found. The fractionalized loop excitations in both the spin and chiral spin liquids obey non-abelian statistics. We characterize this kind of statistics by non-abelian Berry phase and quantum algebra relation. The topological correlation of loops is independent of local order parameter and it measures the intrinsic global quantum entanglement of degenerate ground states.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, final version to be published on Nucl.

These include various forms of fractionalization - elementary excitations that behave as fractions of an electron. While there is not yet entirely convincing experimental evidence that any particular material has a spin liquid ground state, in the past few years, increasing evidence has accumulated for a number of materials suggesting that they have characteristics strongly reminiscent of those expected for a quantum spin liquid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of spin current in quantum spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.06410v2)** | 2016-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin liquid is a state of electron spins in which quantum fluctuation breaks magnetic ordering while maintaining spin correlation. It has been a central topic in magnetism because of its relevance to high-Tc superconductivity and topological states. However, utilizing spin liquid has been quite difficult. Typical spin liquid states are realized in one-dimensional spin systems, called quantum spin chains. Here, we show that a spin liquid in a spin-1/2 quantum chain generates and carries spin current via its long-range spin fluctuation. This is demonstrated by observing an anisotropic negative spin Seebeck effect along the spin chains in Sr2CuO3. The results show that spin current can flow even in an atomic channel owing the spin liquid state, which can be used for atomic spin-current wiring.</p></details> | to be published |
| **[Spin Injection into a Luttinger Liquid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9803158v2)** | 2009-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the effect of spin injection into a Luttinger liquid. The spin-injection-detection setup of Johnson and Silsbee is considered; here spins injected into the Luttinger liquid induce, across an interface with a ferromagnetic metal, either a spin-dependent current ($I_s$) or a spin-dependent boundary voltage ($V_s$). We find that the spin-charge separation nature of the Luttinger liquid affects $I_s$ and $V_s$ in a very different fashion. In particular, in the Ohmic regime, $V_s$ depends on the spin transport properties of the Luttinger liquid in essentially the same way as it would in the case of a Fermi liquid. The implications of our results for the spin-injection-detection experiments in the high $T_c$ cuprates are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, REVTEX, 2 figures.

The organic triangular-lattice system k-(ET)4Hg2.89Br8 is a promising candidate for the doped spin-liquid and hosts a non-Fermi liquid at low pressures. We show that, in the non-Fermi liquid regime, the charge transport confined in the layer gets deconfined sharply at low temperatures, coinciding with the entrance of spins into a quantum regime as signified by a steep decrease in spin susceptibility behaving like the triangular-lattice Heisenberg model indicative of spin-charge separation at high temperatures. This suggests a new type of non-Fermi liquid, where interlayer charge-deconfimement is associated with spin-charge entanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generic Spiral Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03007v2)** | 2021-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiral spin liquids are unique classical spin liquids that occur in many frustrated spin systems, but do not comprise a new phase of matter. Owing to extensive classical ground-state degeneracy, the spins in a spiral spin liquid thermally fluctuate cooperatively from a collection of spiral configurations at low temperatures. These spiral propagation wavevectors form a continuous manifold in reciprocal space, \textit{i.e.}, a spiral contour or a spiral surface, that strongly governs the low-temperature thermal fluctuations and magnetic physics. In this paper, the relevant spin models conveying the spiral spin liquid physics are systematically explored and the geometric origin of the spiral manifold is clarified in the model construction. The spiral spin liquids based on the dimension and the codimension of the spiral manifold are further clarified. For each class, the physical properties are studied both generally and for specific examples. The results are relevant to a wide range of frustrated magnets. A survey of materials is given and future experiments are suggested.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 + ...</summary><p>12 + epsilon pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

By introducing the additional Ising coupling into the honeycomb Kitaev model with bond asymmetry, we discover that the Kitaev spin liquid turns into a spin-nematic quantum paramagnet before a magnetic order is established by the Ising coupling. The quantum phase transition between the two liquid states accompanies a topological change driven by fractionalized excitations, the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes, and is of first order. At finite temperatures, this yields a persisting first-order transition line that terminates at a critical point located deep inside the regime where quantum spins are fractionalized. It is suggested that similar transitions may occur in other perturbed Kitaev magnets with bond asymmetry.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Here, we use density-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic structures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We analyze ten MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess their impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$, we identify two sets of kagome bands, primarily originating from in-plane and out-of-plane Mo d-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three configurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable stability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$ topological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the remaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings guide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable electronic, topological, and magnetic properties.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kagome surface states and weak electronic correlation in vanadium-kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16724v1)** | 2023-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RV6Sn6 (R = Y and lanthanides) with two-dimensional vanadium-kagome surface states is an ideal platform to investigate kagome physics and manipulate the kagome features to realize novel phenomena. Utilizing the micron-scale spatially resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we report a systematical study of the electronic structures of RV6Sn6 (R = Gd, Tb, and Lu) on the two cleaved surfaces, i.e., the V- and RSn1-terminated (001) surfaces. The calculated bands without any renormalization match well with the main ARPES dispersive features, indicating the weak electronic correlation in this system. We observe 'W'-like kagome surface states around the Brillouin zone corners showing R-element-dependent intensities, which is probably due to various coupling strengths between V and RSn1 layers. Our finding suggests an avenue for tuning electronic states by interlayer coupling based on two-dimensional kagome lattices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological chiral kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00217v1)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chirality, a fundamental structural property of crystals, can induce many unique topological quantum phenomena. In kagome lattice, unconventional transports have been reported under tantalizing chiral charge order. Here, we show how by deforming the kagome lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) chiral kagome lattice in which the key band features of the non-chiral 2D kagome lattice - flat energy bands, van Hove singularities (VHSs), and degeneracies - remain robust in both the $k_z$ = 0 and $π$ planes in momentum space. Given the handedness of our kagome lattice, degenerate momentum points possess quantized Chern numbers, ushering in the realization of Weyl fermions. Our 3D chiral kagome lattice surprisingly exhibits 1D behavior on its surface, where topological surface Fermi arc states connecting Weyl fermions are dispersive in one momentum direction and flat in the other direction. These 1D Fermi arcs open up unique possibilities for generating unconventional non-local transport phenomena at the interfaces of domains with different handedness, and the associated enhanced conductance as the separation of the leads on the surface is increased. Employing first-principles calculations, we investigate in-depth the electronic and phononic structures of representative materials within the ten space groups that can support topological chiral kagome lattices. Our study opens a new research direction that integrates the advantages of structural chirality with those of a kagome lattice and thus provides a new materials platform for exploring unique aspects of correlated topological physics in chiral lattices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Topological Quantum Materials with Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04211v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this account, we will give an overview of our research progress on novel quantum properties in topological quantum materials with kagome lattice. Here, there are mainly two categories of kagome materials: magnetic kagome materials and nonmagnetic ones. On one hand, magnetic kagome materials mainly focus on the 3d transition-metal-based kagome systems, including Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, YMn6Sn6, FeSn, and CoSn. The interplay between magnetism and topological bands manifests vital influence on the electronic response. For example, the existence of massive Dirac or Weyl fermions near the Fermi level signicantly enhances the magnitude of Berry curvature in momentum space, leading to a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the peculiar frustrated structure of kagome materials enables them to host a topologically protected skyrmion lattice or noncoplaner spin texture, yielding a topological Hall effect that arises from the realspace Berry phase. On the other hand, nonmagnetic kagome materials in the absence of longrange magnetic order include CsV3Sb5 with the coexistence of superconductivity, charge density wave state, and band topology and van der Waals semiconductor Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$. For these two kagome materials, the tunability of electric response in terms of high pressure or carrier doping helps to reveal the interplay between electronic correlation effects and band topology and discover the novel emergent quantum phenomena in kagome materials.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |
| **[Nonequilibrium control of kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06953v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exotic quantum order in kagome metals, i.e., quantum materials with a Fermi liquid parent state of electrons on a kagome lattice, has appeared as a vibrant emerging field of condensed matter physics. Already in a small kagome material subclass such as vanadium-based compounds $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs), the first wave of experimental exploration has brought about manifold evidence for hitherto largely elusive phenomena such as high-temperature charge ordering with orbital currents, nematic order, cascades of charge ordering transitions with hierarchies of ordering vectors, and unconventional superconductivity. We argue that kagome metals promise to be a prototypical ground for the non-equilibrium analysis of quantum order through time-dependent parameter control and manipulation. In particular, we propose to investigate the nematic character of kagome quantum order through light and strain pulses, as well as the nature of time-reversal symmetry breaking and chirality through properly polarized laser pulses.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Topological kagome magnets and superconductors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11628v1)** | 2022-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A kagome lattice naturally features Dirac fermions, flat bands and van Hove singularities in its electronic structure. The Dirac fermions encode topology, flat bands favour correlated phenomena such as magnetism, and van Hove singularities can lead to instabilities towards long-range many-body orders, altogether allowing for the realization and discovery of a series of topological kagome magnets and superconductors with exotic properties. Recent progress in exploring kagome materials has revealed rich emergent phenomena resulting from the quantum interactions between geometry, topology, spin and correlation. Here we review these key developments in this field, starting from the fundamental concepts of a kagome lattice, to the realizations of Chern and Weyl topological magnetism, to various flat-band many-body correlations, and then to the puzzles of unconventional charge-density waves and superconductivity. We highlight the connection between theoretical ideas and experimental observations, and the bond between quantum interactions within kagome magnets and kagome superconductors, as well as their relation to the concepts in topological insulators, topological superconductors, Weyl semimetals and high-temperature superconductors. These developments broadly bridge topological quantum physics and correlated many-body physics in a wide range of bulk materials and substantially advance the frontier of topological quantum matter.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optical anisotropy of the kagome magnet FeSn: Dominant role of excitations between kagome and Sn layers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12111v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antiferromagnetic FeSn is considered to be a close realization of the ideal two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice, hosting Dirac cones, van Hove singularities, and flat bands, as it comprises Fe$_3$Sn kagome layers well separated by Sn buffer layers. We observe a pronounced optical anisotropy, with the low-energy optical conductivity being surprisingly higher perpendicular to the kagome planes than along the layers. This finding contradicts the prevalent picture of dominantly 2D electronic structure for FeSn. Our material-specific theory reproduces the measured conductivity spectra remarkarbly well. A site-specific decomposition of the optical response to individual excitation channels shows that the optical conductivity for polarizations both parallel and perpendicular to the kagome plane is dominated by interlayer transitions between kagome layers and adjacent Sn-based layers. Moreover, the matrix elements corresponding to these transitions are highly anisotropic, leading to larger out-of-plane conductivity. Our results evidence the crucial role of interstitial layers in charge dynamics even in seemingly 2D systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.
