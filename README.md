| **[Robustness of flat band superconductivity against disorder in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07648v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in flat-band (FB) systems has been the focus of a great deal of activity. This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Phys Rev B (Letter) (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $γ$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $γ$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $γ$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $γ$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultrasound evidence for multicomponent superconducting order parameter in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ with electron quadrupling phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03020v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experiments have pointed to the formation of the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at $x \sim 0.8$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) superconducting state at $T_{\rm c}^{U(1)}$ and normal-metal state at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. We report a theory of the acoustic effects spectroscopy of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements. We show that the experimental results are consistent with BTRS superconductivity at $x \sim 0.8$, fulfilling the necessary condition for the formation of electron quadrupling in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We provide the theoretical basis and the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: v...</summary><p>v3: version accepted by journal. 18 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Novel coupling between charge order and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07272v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay between charge-density waves (CDWs), which break translational symmetry, and spatially homogeneous superconductivity, which breaks global U(1) gauge symmetry, can give rise to an intriguing phenomenon: the pair-density wave, characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter. Yet how CDWs couple to unconventional superconducting states-particularly those with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)-remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts "chirality" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $π$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $δ$ $φ$ = $π$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Enhanced Biomedical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07138v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs; also known as SSPDs) show enormous promise for low-light biomedical imaging by offering exceptional sensitivity, picosecond timing resolution, and broad spectral coverage. Aim: This perspective evaluates the role of SNSPDs by comparing their performance with other photon-counting detectors for emerging biomedical imaging applications. Approach: We outline the need for ultrasensitive detectors for biophotonics, summarize SNSPD operating principles and compare their performance with established photon-counting devices. We highlight applications in which SNSPDs enable new imaging capabilities and discuss system-level challenges and technological developments that are critical to future applications, including clinical translation. Results: SNSPDs offer advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, temporal precision, and detection bandwidth, enabling deeper tissue imaging, high-precision fluorescence lifetime measurements, and quantum-enhanced imaging modalities. Advances in scalable arrays, cryogenic miniaturization, and improved signal collection are reducing barriers to widespread adoption. Conclusions: SNSPDs are poised to transform photon-limited biomedical imaging. As device performance and system integration continue to advance, their adoption in imaging platforms is expected to accelerate. Combining SNSPDs with advancements in the excitation pathway, such as structured-light excitation with Bessel beams, aberration correction, and wavefront shaping, shows promise for delivering unprecedented imaging capabilities and broadening both the preclinical and clinical utility of these detectors.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Fabrication and characterization of Nb/Al-AlN /Nb superconducting tunnel junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06994v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report a Nb/Al-AlN /Nb superconducting tunnel junction process in which the AlN barrier is formed by plasma nitridation using a compact microwave electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) nitrogen plasma source integrated into a standard sputter cluster. This enables growth of uniform tunnel barriers across a broad range of specific resistances, with $R_n A$ down to $\approx 3,Ω,μ\mathrm{m}^2$. Junctions maintain excellent quality, exhibiting $R_j/R_n \ge 25$ at the highest barrier transparencies. We characterize resistivity, specific capacitance, and the evolution of junction parameters under room-temperature aging and thermal annealing. A consistent calibration of the junction specific capacitance $C_s$ versus $R_n A$ is established and independently validated by the performance of demonstrator SIS mixers designed using the extracted $C_s$.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02508v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-liquid and spin-glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08154v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Coincidence detection techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations in strongly correlated electron systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06593v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on strongly correlated electron systems faces a fundamental challenge due to the complex nature of intrinsic many-body correlations. A key strategy to address this challenge lies in advancing experimental methods that can directly probe and elucidate the underlying many-body correlations. In this perspective article, we discuss the theoretically proposed coincidence detection techniques, which are designed to directly measure two-body correlations in various particle-particle and particle-hole channels, with momentum, energy, and/or spatial resolution. We also explore the prospects of these coincidence detection techniques for future theoretical and experimental developments. The successful implementation and refinement of these coincidence detection techniques promise to deliver powerful new approaches for unraveling long-standing puzzles in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the enigmatic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity and the long-sought quantum spin liquids. Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials.</p></details> | 11 pages, no figure |

In this article, we present a \textit{post-experiment} coincidence counting method and propose two \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques, \textit{post-experiment} coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and \textit{post-experiment} coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the \textit{pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with \textit{pulse} photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure and 18-page supplementary material; Revised version for publication</p></details> |
| **[Kitaev Meets AKLT: Competing Quantum Disorder in Spin-3/2 Honeycomb Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06322v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate an S=3/2 quantum spin model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice that continuously interpolates between two paradigmatic quantum disordered states with distinct entanglement structures: the Kitaev quantum spin liquid and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) valence bond solid. Combining classical, semi-classical, and exact diagonalization approaches, we map out the ground-state phase diagram and elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations across the entire parameter range. While classical and semi-classical frameworks predict noncoplanar orders competing with a collinear Néel state, we find these phases to be fragile: once full quantum fluctuations are included, they melt into a quantum-entangled state characterized by suppressed spin correlations and enhanced entanglement entropy. Our findings highlight how competition between qualitatively different quantum disordered phases provides a fertile playground for unconventional phases emerging from their interplay and quantum fluctuations.</p></details> | 6+4pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Biquadratic Interactions in Spin-1 Chains by Spin-1/2 Spacers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26956v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains. Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $β$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $β$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio increases the magnitude of $β$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.</p></details> | 9 figures |

One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of O(N) with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Strain Response as a Probe of Spinons in Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03137v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+7 p...</summary><p>8+7 pages,5+3 figures</p></details> |

From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p></details> |  |

Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures including supplementary information</p></details> |

Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) has the lowest variational energy among SU(6) symmetry-preserving trial wave functions with a periodicity of a 12-site unit cell, as well as uniform chiral states with larger unit cells. It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.</p></details> | 32 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Robust semiclassical magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00223v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence.

Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17398v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large longitudinal and anomalous transverse Magneto-thermoelectric effect in kagome antiferromagnet FeGe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21361v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
