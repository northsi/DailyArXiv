Here we theoretically predict several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like high-temperature superconducting materials. With electron doping to high-pressure bilayer cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, we find that LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$ may show similar crystal structures and strongly correlated electronic structures to bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), the leading pairing symmetry in these materials is $s$-wave.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Axionic nonreciprocal superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05550v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Self-consistent surface superconductivity in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05381v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Observation of the crossover from quantum fluxoid to half-quantum fluxoid in a chiral superconducting device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09431v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial application such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For the real application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \pi with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed by topological superconductivity.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Phonon-mediated intrinsic topological superconductivity in Fermi arcs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03250v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that phonons can intrinsically mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, accepted in Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Regular hyperbolic lattices and Ginzburg-Landau theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09330v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study $s$-wave superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for discrete hyperbolic lattices and the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the continuous hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic lattices maintain a finite fraction of boundary sites regardless of system size, thus fundamentally altering superconductivity through enhanced boundary effects absent in flat space. Within the BCS framework for hyperbolic lattices, uniform systems reproduce standard bulk behavior, whereas finite systems with open boundaries, studied through exact diagonalization and Cayley-tree approximations, exhibit boundary-enhanced superconductivity and boundary-only superconducting states that persist above the bulk critical temperature. Numerical studies further reveal that boundary termination critically determines superconducting properties; in particular, rough boundaries with dangling bonds generate zero-energy modes that raise critical temperatures by several times relative to smooth boundaries. Turning to the complementary Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the hyperbolic plane, we find that finite geometries permit radial variations of the condensate absent in infinite space. Owing to the interplay between coherence length and curvature radius, the theory exhibits two types of superconductivity even without magnetic fields, with vortices replaced by lines of vanishing order parameter in the nontrivial type. Our findings establish hyperbolic geometry as a platform for engineering boundary-controlled superconductivity, opening new directions for physics in curved spaces in condensed matter and holography.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures, 1 appendix</p></details> |
| **[Ambient-pressure superconductivity and electronic structures of engineered hybrid nickelate films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03502v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.</p></details> |  |

Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10760v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta>0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: results improved by dropping the non flatness of free energy condition.

| **[Time-dependent correlations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter above the spin-glass transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08955v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \times 10^{\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper with supplementary sections</p></details> |
| **[Envelope representation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20610v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages; journal version</p></details> |
| **[Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</p></details> | 29 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03022v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical aging is one of the non-equilibrium phenomena where physical properties change over time due to structural relaxation. Aging in spin glass systems has been explained by a trap model on the temperature-independent energy landscape. Meanwhile, in the free energy landscape (FEL) approach to aging phenomena, it is assumed that the FEL responds to temperature changes with a time delay. In this paper, aging in a glass forming model in which both the trapping effect and the delayed response of the FEL exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript |
| **[Efficient strategy for Parallel Minority Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02770v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the parallel Minority Game, where a group of agents, each having two choices, try to independently decide on a strategy such that they stay on minority between their own two choices. However, there are multiple such groups of agents, and some of them have common choices. This overlap brings in additional competition among the agents making the variance reduction a complex optimization problem. We study multiple stochastic strategies and find that the most efficient strategy is the one where the agents have just the memory of their last visit to the their alternative choice. The resulting dynamics, even though giving the lowest population variance among the strategies studied here, end up in a frozen state. However, the frozen state does not bring the the variance to its lowest possible value; a situation qualitatively analogous to spin-glass systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14105v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</p></details> | 36 pages |

As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model can be interpreted as a (random) numerical base. We also show an application to the Primon gas and the Riemann Zeta Function.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Imperfections like vacancies, atomic substitutions, lattice distortions, and microstructural inhomogeneities, disrupt ideal periodicity thereby altering physical properties. Analogous to spin-glass systems, electrical 'glassiness' arises when charge carriers confront disordered energy landscapes, leading to a broad range of relaxation times, especially in polycrystalline materials where dipoles experience competing exchange interactions. Complex impedance, permittivity, and electric modulus distill out separate resistive and capacitive effects, offering insights into how microstructural inhomogeneities affects conduction mechanism. In polycrystalline double perovskites A2SmTaO6 (A = Ba, Ca), with a power law driven ac conductivity, the hopping and relaxation of carriers is affected by both grains and grain boundaries. Scaling of ac conductivity and impedance response reveals correlation between conduction and relaxation timescales. The inhomogeneities in local energy landscape of 'frustrated' dipoles restrict the 'universality' of conduction mechanism across the bulk length scale.</p></details> |  |

| **[Computational search for materials having a giant anomalous Hall effect in the pyrochlore and spinel crystal structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18320v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16239v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moir√© excitons in generalized Wigner crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08211v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moir\'e superlattices of transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers host strong Coulomb interactions residing in narrow electron bands, leading to correlated insulating states at fractional carrier doping densities, known as generalized Wigner crystals. In excited states, the formation of moir\'e excitons is expected to be fundamentally shaped by the Wigner-crystal ground states, manifesting an intricate interplay between electronic and excitonic correlations. However, the microscopic description of these Wigner crystalline excitons (WCEs) remains elusive, largely subject to speculations, and is further needed for the understanding of exotic excitonic phases (e.g., exciton insulators and exciton density waves) and their unique properties (e.g., anomalous exciton diffusion). Here, using first-principles many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we directly reveal the internal structures of WCEs in angle-aligned MoSe2/MoS2 moir\'e heterostructure at hole fillings of 1/3 and 2/3. Our results unveil the propagation of correlation effects from the ground state to excited states, shaping the real-space characteristics of WCEs. The strong two-particle excitonic correlations dominate over the kinetic energy of free electron-hole pairs, in analog to the strong single-particle correlations of flat bands. We propose that such unusual excited-state correlation effects of WCEs can be experimentally probed by photocurrent tunneling microscopy. Our work provides a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated WCEs, suggesting them as a highly tunable mixed boson-fermion platform to study many-body interactions and phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03601v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states, characterized by an envelope function with finite vorticity in momentum space. This vorticity is determined by the underlying topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless of the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate how band topology affects exciton properties, offering a framework for predicting light-matter interactions in topological materials with flat bands.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Symmetry-enforced Moir√© Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06906v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</p></details> | 43 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03039v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 + ...</summary><p>12 + 6 pages, 4 + 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05958v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages, 3+1 figures.

| **[Exact models of chiral flat-band superconductors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21127v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</p></details> |  |
