| **[Real-time adaptive tracking of fluctuating relaxation rates in superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09576v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is fundamentally bounded by environmental decoherence. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of nonadaptive experimental protocols limits temporal precision and can average out rapid features of the underlying dynamics. Here, we overcome this temporal-resolution limit by two orders of magnitude using a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) powered classical controller that adaptively and continuously tracks the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. We report events in which the relaxation time switches by nearly an order of magnitude over timescales of just tens of milliseconds, rather than minutes or hours as previously reported. Our real-time Bayesian estimation protocol estimates relaxation times within a few milliseconds, close to the decoherence timescale itself. Our statistical analysis further suggests that some of these fast fluctuations arise from two-level systems switching at rates up to 10 Hz, four orders of magnitude faster than earlier reports. These results redefine the timescales relevant for calibration in superconducting quantum processing units, establish a reference for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening, and improve our understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text 13 pages, 4 figures, plus 22 supplementary pages, 12 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[High-Tc Superconductivity in Functionalized Out-of-Plane Ordered Double Transition Metal MXenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12960v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors attracted growing interest in condensed-matter physics research. In this work, we explore the superconducting properties of surface-functionalized, out-of-plane ordered double transition-metal MXenes (o-MXenes), which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic characteristics. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC), anharmonicity, and anisotropy effect in superconductivity properties of o-MXenes. We examine a wide range of o-MXene systems, M$_{2}$M$^\prime$X$_{2}$T$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; M$^\prime$ = Sc, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Nb, Ta; X = C, N), functionalized with F, O, Cl, and H groups. Out of 128 candidates, 32 compounds are found to be mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures (T$_{c}$) from 0.1 K to 52 K. Notably, the Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ compound achieves the highest T$_{c}$ of 52 K, with a superconducting gap of $\sim$10 meV. Solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equation reveals that Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ is an anisotropic two-gap superconductor, and incorporating anharmonic effects decreases its T$_{c}$ slightly. We further analyze flat-band-induced EPC enhancement and present EPC matrix elements as functions of phonon wavevector q for distinct vibrational modes that show anharmonic behavior of these materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Operation of Wafer-Scale Packages Containing >500 Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12773v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~μ$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page main text containing 7 figures. 7 page SI with 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Introduction to High-Temperature Superconductivity for Solid State Chemists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12608v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity is one of the most amazing properties that metallic conductors exhibit. Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages, 50 figures, submitted to Progress in Solid State Chemistry</p></details> |
| **[Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protocols for a many-body phase microscope: From coherences and d-wave superconductivity to Green's functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12142v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06781v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[Experimental setup for the combined study of spin ensembles and superconducting quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11739v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 + 8...</summary><p>8 + 8 pages, 3 + 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing energy gap in quantum spin liquids via polarization amplitude](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12990v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23962v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations: (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_Δ$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)). These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 36 figures.

| **[Footprints of the Kitaev spin liquid in the Fano lineshapes of the Raman active optical phonons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08878v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theoretical description of the Raman spectroscopy in the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev system and show that it can provide intriguing observable signatures of fractionalized excitations characteristic of the underlying spin liquid phase. In particular, we obtain the explicit form of the phonon modes and construct the coupling Hamiltonians based on $D_{3d}$ symmetry. We then systematically compute the Raman intensity and show that the spin-phonon coupling renormalizes phonon propagators and generates the salient Fano linshape. We find that the temperature evolution of the Fano lineshape displays two crossovers, and the low temperature crossover shows pronounced magnetic field dependence. We thus identify the observable effect of the Majorana fermions and the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes encoded in the Fano lineshape. Our results explain several phonon Raman scattering experiments in the candidate material $α$-RuCl$_3$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Such additional interaction correspond to the nearest and diagonal interactions on the square lattice. Phase diagram of the bare Kitaev model consist of low entangled commensurate magnetic phases and entangled Kitaev spin liquid. Anisotropic Ising interaction allows the entangled quantum paramagnetic phases in the phase diagram, which in the absence of the magnetic field previously was predicted for more complex type of interaction. We study the scaling law of the entanglement entropy and the bond dimension of the matrix product state with the size of the system. In addition, we propose an optimization algorithm to prevent DMRG from getting stuck in the low-entangled phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground-state phases of $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg models on the body-centered cubic lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10008v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09709v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a elliptically polarized d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |

Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p></details> |  |

Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text: 14 pages, 7 figures. supplement: 1 page, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Nature Physics</p></details> |

Some of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. More recently, experiments have reported the emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic loop-current bond order (NLCBO) that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Examining an effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove singularity at each $M$ point, we find that frustration of the complex order-parameter phases leads to NLCBO. We further present conditions for overcoming other competing phases, including isotropic charge-bond and loop-current orders. Applying our findings to a previously studied model for $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ $(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$, we find that NLCBO emerges within a small region of phase space within mean-field theory. Our theory provides a microscopic description that goes beyond symmetry-allowed free-energy analyses and is broadly applicable to other Kagome metals featuring van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anisotropy, frustration and saddle point in the twisted Kagome antiferromagnet ErPdPb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08900v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</p></details> |  |
| **[Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions of the antiferromagnetic Ising model with ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions on the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07401v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the six-state clock universality of the Ising model on the kagome lattice, considering antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) and ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. Our comprehensive study employs three approaches: the level-spectroscopy method, Monte Carlo simulations, and a machine-learning phase classification technique. In this system, we observe two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. We present a phase diagram consisting of three phases: the low-temperature ordered phase with sublattice magnetizations, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase, as a function of the ratio of the NNN interaction to the NN interaction. We verify the six-state clock universality through the machine-learning study, which uses data from the six-state clock model on the kagome lattice for training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Topological superconductivity on a kagome magnet coupled to a Rashba superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07383v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Epitaxial growth and magneto-transport properties of kagome metal FeGe thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06344v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics due to the charge density wave (CDW) being well below its magnetic transition temperature. Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
