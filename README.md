| **[Dominant Excitonic Superconductivity in a Three-component Hubbard Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08784v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04819v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Effect of thermal fluctuations on topological crossover in the chiral d+id superconducting phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08527v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effect of thermal fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the topological index C1 of the chiral d+id superconducting phase of a two-dimensional single-band model on a triangular lattice is investigated. Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries.</p></details> | 7 pages,9 figure |
| **[Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19279v9)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective of physics of information dynamics, modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Loop network topology abstraction using the model separates the flowing patterns of information from its physical constraints and describes systems of any scale and complexity. The accuracy of flow statistics are limited by the resolution of local external measuring clock(s) revealing the universal nature of information dynamics through the stated two principles.</p></details> | 6 figures, 26 pages |
| **[Coherence-limited digital control of a superconducting qubit using a Josephson pulse generator at 3 K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07962v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Applied Physics Letters</p></details> |
| **[Robustness of flat band superconductivity against disorder in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07648v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in flat-band (FB) systems has been the focus of a great deal of activity. This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Phys Rev B (Letter) (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $γ$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $γ$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $γ$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $γ$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</p></details> |  |

| **[Triangular $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08768v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The behavior of the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field remains unsettled despite decades of study. We map out the phase diagram using three complementary approaches, including self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo. This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 + 1...</summary><p>6 + 11 pages, 3 + 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exactly solvable spin liquids in Kitaev bilayers and moiré superlattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04181v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the recent advancements on moiré superlattices, we propose an exactly solvable model with Kitaev-type interactions on a bilayer honeycomb lattice for both AA stacking and moiré superlattices. Using Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we uncover a rich variety of phases where the intra and interlayer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes (visons) are arranged in a periodic fashion in the ground state, tuned by interlayer coupling and out-of-plane external magnetic field. We further extend our model to moiré superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized arrangements of plaquette values that correlate with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moiré unit cell. Moreover, we find that, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moiré superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08712v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 Figures |

We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven toward the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 27 figures.

| **[Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02508v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-liquid and spin-glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08154v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

A key strategy to address this challenge lies in advancing experimental methods that can directly probe and elucidate the underlying many-body correlations. In this perspective article, we discuss the theoretically proposed coincidence detection techniques, which are designed to directly measure two-body correlations in various particle-particle and particle-hole channels, with momentum, energy, and/or spatial resolution. We also explore the prospects of these coincidence detection techniques for future theoretical and experimental developments. The successful implementation and refinement of these coincidence detection techniques promise to deliver powerful new approaches for unraveling long-standing puzzles in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the enigmatic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity and the long-sought quantum spin liquids. Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials.</p></details> | 11 pages, no figure |

In this article, we present a \textit{post-experiment} coincidence counting method and propose two \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques, \textit{post-experiment} coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and \textit{post-experiment} coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the \textit{pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with \textit{pulse} photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure and 18-page supplementary material; Revised version for publication</p></details> |

Combining classical, semi-classical, and exact diagonalization approaches, we map out the ground-state phase diagram and elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations across the entire parameter range. While classical and semi-classical frameworks predict noncoplanar orders competing with a collinear Néel state, we find these phases to be fragile: once full quantum fluctuations are included, they melt into a quantum-entangled state characterized by suppressed spin correlations and enhanced entanglement entropy. Our findings highlight how competition between qualitatively different quantum disordered phases provides a fertile playground for unconventional phases emerging from their interplay and quantum fluctuations.</p></details> | 6+4pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</p></details> |  |

From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Phys....</summary><p>Phys.

Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</p></details> |  |

Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations over the non-interacting vacuum within a single-mode gyrotropic cavity. The gyrotropic cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking and stabilizes a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures including supplementary information</p></details> |

Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) has the lowest variational energy among SU(6) symmetry-preserving trial wave functions with a periodicity of a 12-site unit cell, as well as uniform chiral states with larger unit cells. It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.</p></details> | 32 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Robust semiclassical magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00223v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17398v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</p></details> |  |
