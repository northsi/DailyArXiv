| **[Repulsive-Interaction-Driven Topological Superconductivity in a Landau Level Coupled to an $s$-Wave Superconductor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04700v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons, such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote, pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01273v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</p></details> | 41 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Systematic evolution of superconducting pairing strength and Seebeck coefficients in correlated infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04431v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$ exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04203v3)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio-frequency cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented by Zarea {\it et al.} [Front. Supercond. Mater. 3, 1 (2023), arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported by Ueki {\it et al.} [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 5, 053I02 (2025), arXiv:2207.14236] points toward a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 5 appendices</p></details> |
| **[Nonsymmorphic symmetry protected hourglass Dirac chain topology and conventional superconductivity in ZrIrGe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03188v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ternary transition-metal germanide superconductors with nonsymmorphic symmetries offer promising platforms for symmetry-protected topological phases. In this work, we investigate ZrIrGe, which crystallizes in the nonsymmorphic TiNiSi-type structure. Electrical, magnetic, and specific heat measurements confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a full gap and a transition temperature of 2.84(7) K, consistent with weak-coupling BCS behavior. First-principles calculations reveal hourglass-shaped bulk band dispersions and a Dirac chain composed of symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate Dirac points, leading to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, ZrIrGe exhibits a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological character, resulting in helical surface states that cross the Fermi level, making it a strong candidate for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional superconductivity and topological band features establishes ZrIrGe as a rare stoichiometric system for exploring intrinsic topological superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, Accepted in Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Cavity-altered superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17378v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. Our work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of complex quantum materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Low-beta Nb$_3$Sn Cavity for ATLAS and Future Ion Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17934v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on a Nb$_3$Sn-coated low-beta superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity intended for accelerating ions. We aim to apply the cavity in ATLAS, our Argonne National Laboratory user facility for nuclear physics studies with ion beams in the energy range of 5-20 MeV/u. The Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, a 145 MHz quarter-wave optimized for ions moving with velocity $\beta$=v/c=0.08 exhibits an order-of-magnitude reduction in radiofrequency (RF) losses into helium at $4.4\,\mathrm{K}$ compared to a superconducting niobium (Nb) cavity at the same frequency and temperature. Experimentally measured fields are among the highest to date for any Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, reaching a peak surface magnetic field of 105 mT. We also present a practical solution to the problem of cavity frequency tuning. Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb3Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics. The same Nb$_3$Sn cavity technology offers broad benefits for future ion accelerators.</p></details> |  |

The search used a custom-made radio-frequency cavity coated with high-temperature superconducting tape. A set of 27 h of data at a resonant frequency of around 8.84 GHz was analysed. In the range of axion mass 36.5676 $\mu$eV to 36.5699 $\mu$eV, corresponding to a width of 554 kHz, no signal excess hinting at an axion-like particle was found. Correspondingly, in this mass range, a limit on the axion to photon coupling-strength was set in the range between g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 6.2e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ and g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 1.59e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ with a 95% confidence level.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures v2: Accepted version for publication in JHEP</p></details> |
| **[Spontaneous generation of athermal phonon bursts within bulk silicon causing excess noise, low energy background events and quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16092v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solid state phonon detectors used in the search for dark matter and coherent neutrino nucleus interactions (CE$\nu$NS) require excellent energy resolution (eV-scale or below) and low backgrounds. An unknown source of phonon bursts, the low energy excess (LEE), dominates other above-threshold backgrounds and generates excess shot noise from sub-threshold bursts. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cooldown in two nearly identical 1 cm$^2$ silicon detectors that differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs. 4 mm thick). We find that both the channel-correlated shot noise and near-threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, both the correlated shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise, we estimate that the energy scale for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \pm 0.38$ meV. In our final dataset, we report a world-leading energy resolution of 258.5$\pm$0.4 meV in the 1 mm thick detector. Simple calculations suggest that these silicon substrate phonon bursts are likely a significant source of quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting qubits operated in well shielded and vibration free environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Active-Learning Inspired Ab Initio Theory-Experiment Loop Approach for Management of Material Defects: Application to Superconducting Qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02544v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures (7 images)</p></details> |

The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 1 table + 21 pages, 14 figures. v3: close to published version</p></details> |

One of the fundamental results of the theory is the Parisi formula, which identifies the limit of the free energy of a large class of such models. Yet many interesting models remain out of reach of the classical theory, and direct generalizations of the Parisi formula yield invalid predictions. I will report here on some partial progress towards the resolution of this problem, which also brings a new perspective on classical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; contribution to the proceedings of the ICM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Bias and Spectral Properties of Single-Head Attention in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24914v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Efficient Sampling of Three-Dimensional Spin Glasses and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23945v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>SB, C...</summary><p>SB, CD, SC, KL are equally contributing authors</p></details> |
| **[Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model in a Quantum Glassy Landscape](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22977v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a generalization of `Yukawa models' in which Majorana fermions, interacting via all-to-all random couplings as in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, are parametrically coupled to disordered bosonic degrees of freedom described by a quantum $p-$spin model. The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 Figures including Appendices</p></details> |
| **[Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario.

| **[Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns.

Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p></details> |  |

We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures; close to published version</p></details> |
| **[Moiré excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05204v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetoelectric Switching of Competing Magnetic Orders in Rhombohedral Graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24672v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Strong Correlations and Superconductivity in the Supermoiré Lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24670v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supermoir\'e lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moir\'e patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moir\'e flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoir\'e lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoir\'e lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoir\'e mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoir\'e lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoir\'e lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moir\'e flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoir\'e lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ideal quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03617v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interplay of quantum geometry and interactions determines the correlated state properties of flat bands. Here, we investigate the ideal quantum geometry (IQG), i.e., the property that the trace of quantum metric equals the Berry curvature, in the surface flat bands of rhombohedrally stacked graphene (RG) multilayers. We show that RG represents a class of semimetals with IQG, among which only RG has a nonvanishing IQG at the center of the surface bands. In the presence of long-range hoppings, a displacement field polarizes the electron density to one of the two surfaces, stabilizing the IQG and boosting transitions to correlated phases like superconductivity. Analyzing the superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state in a many-layer RG, we reveal a heavy-fermion picture where the "heavy electrons" carry a nonzero supercurrent. This unusual behavior arises from the IQG of the surface states, which suggests a large fraction of supercurrent running on the surface of RG.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Framework for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Interlayer Coupling and Far-Field Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23952v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moir\'e potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.</p></details> |  |

In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |

Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04326v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and feedback are warmly welcomed.

How those interact is determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely on $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping. Analyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and multi-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg edge-sharing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02460v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 84 references, Supplemental Material with additional figure and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |

Here, we investigate candidate triangular QSL material YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ and discover the absence of magnetic order, but also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural disorder. We instead look at the results through a lens of a 2-dimensional (2D) random singlet phase. YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ behaves strikingly similar to other disordered triangular lattice materials, suggesting universal behavior of random singlet formation in 2D frustrated systems.</p></details> | LA-UR-25-29531 |

The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Schwinger boson theory for $S=1$ Kitaev quantum spin liquids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25761v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model, which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
