In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures for the main text + 15 pages, 9 figures for Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14259v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$- and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level. Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several experiments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures, |
| **[Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopy of Superconductivity with the Quantum Twisting Microscope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13641v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a theoretical framework for probing superconductivity with momentum resolution using the quantum twisting microscope (QTM), a planar tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional sample. Due to in-plane momentum conservation, the QTM directly measures the superconducting spectral function along well-defined trajectories in momentum space. The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions. Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In: A First-Principles Insight into Indium-Based Compounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and nontrivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature \( T_c \approx 14\ \mathrm{K} \) at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, \( T_c \) increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of the superconductivity in pressurized La3-xSmxNi2O7](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13342v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 80 K and the increased superconducting transition temperature, $T_\text{c}$, up to 92 K in single crystals of La$_2$SmNi$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we systematically study the effect of Sm doping on the superconductivity and structure of La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1.5) under pressure. Experimental investigations in polycrystalline samples reveal that Sm doping monotonically decreases the lattice constants $c$ and $a$, thereby enhancing crystal structure distortion and leading to an evolution of the metallic ground state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to an insulating state in La$_{1.5}$Sm$_{1.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The maximum onset $T_\text{c}$ in compounds $x=0.9$ and 1.5 is 89 K, while the pressure that drives the emergence of superconductivity is higher for higher doping levels. The results suggest that the enhancement of $T_\text{c}$ in La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is mainly affected by the compressed $c$ lattice before saturation, and the structure transition is critical for the emergence of superconductivity. Our experimental results provide insight into the influence of elemental substitution on nickelate superconductors, offering a means to increase the transition temperature further.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Long-Range Chiral Pairing enables Topological Superconductivity in Triangular Lattices without Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetic Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13120v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper demonstrates a pathway to topological superconductivity in monolayer triangular lattices through long-range pairing without requiring spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, contrasting conventional frameworks reliant on superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. Berry curvature analysis reveals spontaneous TRS-breaking-induced peaks or valleys under long-range pairing, signaling nontrivial topology superconducting state. Notably, the increase in the long-range pairing strength only changes the size of the energy band-gap, without triggering a topological phase transition. This characteristic is verified by calculating Berry curvature and topological edge states. In zigzag and armchair-edge ribbons of finite width, the topological edge states are regulated by the ribbon boundary symmetry and the interact range of long-range pairing. Under nearest-neighbor pairing, the topological edge states maintain particle-hole symmetry and matches the corresponding Chern number. However, next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor pairings break the particle-hole symmetry of the topological edge states in armchair-edge ribbon. This work proposes a mechanism for realizing topological superconductivity without relying on spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, offering a theoretical foundation for simplifying the design of topological quantum devices.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Evidence of de Almeida--Thouless line below six dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Networks of neural networks: more is different](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Beyond-classical computation in quantum simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00910v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</p></details> | 32 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10345v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Magnetic Correlations in La2Mn2-xNixO6: Role of Crystal Structure in Double Perovskites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10012v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The magnetic correlations in double perovskites La2Mn2-xNixO6 (x = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5) have been systematically investigated across macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic length scales using temperature-dependent bulk DC magnetization, neutron depolarization, and neutron powder diffraction measurements, respectivitly. The magnetic properties evolve from a long-range ferromagnetic (FM) order to a cluster ferromagnetic or spin-glass (FM or SG) behavior as the Ni concentration increases. This evolution is directly linked to changes in the crystal structure, transitioning from pure orthorhombic (x=0.5) to mixed orthorhombic and monoclinic (x=0.75-1.0), and eventually to mixed trigonal and monoclinic symmetries (x=1.25-1.5). Ni substitution enhances the magnetic ordering temperature from 170 K (x=0.5) to 280 K (x=1.0), but this is accompanied by a reduction in both magnetization and ordered magnetic moment. Beyond x=1.0, any long-range magnetic ordering is absent. Additionally, all compositions exhibit a reentrant spin-glass-like phase at low temperatures (below about 50 K). Neutron diffraction analysis confirms that long-range FM order occurs only in the orthorhombic phase, while the monoclinic and trigonal phases lack such magnetic ordering. The temperature-dependent magnetic correlations are closely connected to variations in crystal structural parameters, including lattice constants and unit cell volume. The electrical conductivity behavior, following the variable range hopping (VRH) model, highlights the role of multivalence Mn and Ni ions on the electrical properties. This study elucidates the microscopic mechanisms behind the tunable magnetic and electrical properties of La2Mn2-xNixO6, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced materials for spintronic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, Phys.

| **[Generalized Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07420v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unique Hierarchical Rotational Dynamics Induces Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Cyanide-bridged Framework Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14692v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of materials combining light constituent elements with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$) is crucial to advancing technologies like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings, yet it remains a formidable challenge to date. Herein, we achieve ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs) through the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical vibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics exhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to multiple negative peaks in Gr\"uneisen parameters across a wide frequency range, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic anharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large four-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide bandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes) leads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials. Consequently, the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like materials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the Cd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga, In) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from 0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich platform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new paradigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials via the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states from non-Chern flat bands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14685v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1 filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for (non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the Chern band paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Among the phases observed, a nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for understanding correlated flat-band phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+3 p...</summary><p>6+3 pages, 5+1 figures</p></details> |

By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance, whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures; Comments are welcome!</p></details> |
| **[Buckling and flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13471v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening. While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Computational Insights into Defect Induced Modulation in Electronic Properties of 2D Nitride Monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13440v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-dimensional (2D) nitride materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$), and beryllonitrene (BeN$_4$) have emerged as promising candidates for next generation electronic, optoelectronic, and energy applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. This study presents a systematic investigation of the effects of vacancy defect, specifically the role of nitrogen and constituent atom vacancies on the electronic properties of these materials. Our findings reveal that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies significantly alters the electronic characteristics of these materials. In h-BN, the presence of a nitrogen monovacancy significantly lowers the work function from 5.97 eV to 3.45 eV, one of the lowest values reported for any 2D material. Additionally, this defect reduces the band gap from 4.6 eV to 0.64 eV, driving the material toward half-metallic behavior. This is accompanied by the emergence of flat bands near the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron-electron interactions. In g-C$_3$N$_4$, nitrogen vacancies lead to a decrease in work function and band gap, with double nitrogen vacancies rendering the material nearly metallic. In BeN$_4$, nitrogen vacancies result in minimal charge redistribution and a slight increase in work function, highlighting the material's unique electronic behavior. These results underscore the potential of vacancy engineering in tuning the electronic properties of 2D nitride materials, offering avenues for the design of materials with tailored work functions and band gaps for applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and catalysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 10 figures with supporting information of 20 pages,14 figures</p></details> |
| **[Flat bands in condensed-matter systems -- perspective for magnetism and superconductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13098v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a recent upsurge of interests in flat bands in condensed-matter systems and the consequences for magnetism and superconductivity. This article highlights the physics, where peculiar quantum-mechanical mechanisms for the physical properties such as flatband ferromagnetism and flatband superconductivity that arise when the band is not trivially flat but has a strange Hilbert space with non-orthogonalisable Wannier states, which goes far beyond just the diverging density of states. Peculiar wavefunctions come from a quantum-mechanical interference and entanglement. Interesting phenomena become even remarkable when many-body interactions are introduced, culminating in flatband superconductivity as well as flatband ferromagnetism. Flatband physics harbours a very wide range physics indeed, extending to non-equilibrium physics in laser illumination, where Floquet states for topologcial superconductivity is promoted in flatbands. While these are theoretically curious, possible candidates for the flatband materials are beginning to emerge, which is also described. These provide a wide and promising outlook.</p></details> | 63 pages, 43 figures |

However, perfect spin Hall quantization is often hindered by spin mixing from strong spin-orbit coupling, and the emergence of such VHSs is highly sensitive to material-specific electronic structures. Here, we predict a class of seven-layered square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo/W, A = Si/Ge, Z = Pnictogen) isomers that host a robust, large-gap QSH phase with nearly quantized spin Hall conductivity and intrinsic high-order VHSs. Topological and symmetry analyses reveal that compounds with Z = P, As, and Sb are $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nontrivial with spin Chern number $C_s = 1$ and support $S_z$-polarized edge states, while those with Z = N are trivial insulators. The QSH phase features an $S_z$-conserving spin Hamiltonian consistent with an emergent spin $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quasi-symmetry, yielding spin Hall conductivity $\sim 2e^2/h$. Notably, MA$_2$(As, Sb)$_4$ compounds exhibit quasi-flat bands near the Fermi level in the inverted regime, with WSi$_2$Sb$_4$ additionally hosting four high-order VHSs at generic momentum points. These results position square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials as robust QSH insulators for realizing quantized spin Hall conductivity and correlated topological phases, including fractionalized states and possibly non-Abelian anyons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exotic Surface Stripe Orders in Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12888v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0 stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+11 ...</summary><p>9+11 pages, 3+8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03146v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16978v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11678v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 5 figures, 8 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: 6...</summary><p>v2: 68pages, typos are corrected</p></details> |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 95 references, Supplemental Material with additional figure and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
| **[Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07383v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Phonon Hall Viscosity and the Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect of $α$-RuCl$_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06443v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.</p></details> |  |
