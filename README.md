| **[Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08248v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 figure, Proceedings of the International School of Physics "Enrico Fermi", Course 211 - Quantum Mixtures with Ultra-cold Atoms, July 2022</p></details> |
| **[Coexistence of near-EF van Hove singularity and in-gap topological Dirac surface states in superconducting electrides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22995v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>See a...</summary><p>See also our related works on the formation mechanisms of electrides and their connection to SC and unconventional metallic behavior: "Evidence for Anion-Electron Duality and Enhanced Superconducting Role of Interstitial Anionic Electrons in Electrides" and "Interstitial Anionic Electrons-Involved Superconductivity and T-Linear Resistivity Behavior in Electride"</p></details> |
| **[Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary Information will be available later</p></details> |
| **[Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00625v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional s-wave superconductivity in regular 3D (or 2D) metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' SC that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being SC is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We discuss both 2D and 3D cases, focusing mostly on the 3D case. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K for s-wave SC in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $>10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the $T_c$ of the 3D (or 2D) electron gas can be reduced well below $\sim1$ K depending on choices of frequency cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered 60 years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-s-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, add results for 2D</p></details> |
| **[Correlations between superconducting and resistive anisotropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22796v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</p></details> |  |
| **[Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted by Nature Communications</p></details> |

| **[Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagomé lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14772v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagomé lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the kagomé lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms. The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 13figures, to be published in Phys.

A critical open question is whether the underlying normal state is a Fermi liquid with a large Fermi surface or a strongly correlated metal with low carrier density. In this work, we develop a theory of the phases emerging from doping the $ν= -2/3$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We establish a duality between this problem and doping a gapped SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid (CSL).</p></details> | 9+5 pages; 1 figures |

By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Unconventional orders in the maple-leaf ferro-antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21598v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hardware Acceleration of Frustrated Lattice Systems using Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20911v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric frustration gives rise to emergent quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter. While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability. This work paves a pathway for scalable digital hardware that embeds physical symmetries to enable large scale simulations of material systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added temperature analysis. 7+10 pages, 4+6 figures</p></details> |

The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+γk_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $γ$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20261v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $Γ$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $Γ$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $Γ$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22002v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</p></details> |  |

While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09402v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Spin Excitations and Flat Electronic Bands in a Cr-based Kagome Superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05293v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the quest for topology- and correlation-driven quantum states, kagome lattice materials have garnered significant interest for their band structures, featuring flat bands (FBs) from the quantum destructive interference of the electronic wavefunction. Tuning an FB to the chemical potential could induce electronic instabilities and emergent orders. Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their role in emergent orders in bulk materials remains lacking. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and density functional theory, we show that the low-energy structure of the Cr-based kagome metal superconductor {\Cr} is dominated by FBs at the Fermi level. We also observe low-energy magnetic excitations evolving across the low-temperature transition, largely consistent with the FB shift. Our results suggest that the low-temperature order contains a magnetic origin and that the kagome FBs may play a role in the emergence of this order.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications 16, 7573 (2025). 11 pages, 4 main figures, 13 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10976v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrons of $d$-symmetry interacting with a localized non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin order on a kagome lattice are considered. Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</p></details> | <details><summary>6.5 p...</summary><p>6.5 pages main text + 9 pages supplementary materials, additional details on the method used and results for more general case</p></details> |
| **[Kagome metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12731v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</p></details> | 64 pages, 31 figures |
| **[Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer kagome lattice Cr3Se4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09884v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
