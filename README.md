| **[What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[High temperature superconductivity with giant pressure effect in 3D networks of boron doped ultra-thin carbon nanotubes in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19255v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase Stability and Superconductivity in Hydrogenated and Lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) Monolayers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19922v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrogen and lithium functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a promising route to enhance electronic properties and induce superconductivity. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the phase stability and superconducting behavior of hydrogenated and lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) monolayers. Among Ga2SH, Ga2SLi, GaInSH, and GaInSLi, only the 2H-GaInSLi structure is dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon dispersion, ab initio molecular dynamics, and elastic constants. This monolayer adopts a hexagonal lattice, exhibits metallic behavior, and has a negative formation energy, suggesting experimental feasibility. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.8 K. Notably, three distinct superconducting gaps emerge, linked to specific atomic orbitals and phonon modes. Electron doping of 0.2 e per cell increases Tc to nearly 6.2 K while maintaining the three-gap character. These results highlight the effectiveness of selective functionalization in engineering superconductivity and identify GaInSLi as a promising platform for next-generation multi-gap 2D superconducting devices.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Theoretical prediction of Structural Stability and Superconductivity in Janus Ti2CSH MXene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19907v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural stability, vibrational characteristics, and superconducting properties of the Janus Ti2CSH monolayer. Janus MXene (JMXene) materials, such as Ti2CSH, have attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic two-dimensional structure and the absence of out-of-plane symmetry, which give rise to novel physical phenomena. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of the monolayer, while electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling analyses reveal a strong phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts a single-gap superconducting state, with gap values between 4.29 and 4.71 meV at 10 K and a critical temperature Tc of 22.6 K. These findings establish Ti2CSH as a promising two-dimensional superconductor with potential applications in quantum and nanoscale technologies.</p></details> | 13 Pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Ab initio investigation on structural stability and phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D-hydrogenated M2X (M= Mo, V, Zr; X=C, N) MXene monolayer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19904v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M = Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H) generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2), corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a candidate for Dirac physics.</p></details> | 13 Pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11603v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Roles of Fe-ion irradiation on MgB$_2$ thin films: Structural, superconducting, and optical properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19697v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effects of Fe-ion irradiation on the crystal structure and superconducting properties of MgB$_2$ thin films were investigated. Pristine samples were prepared using hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), and ion irradiation was performed at three different doses of 5 x 10$^{13}$, 1 x 10$^{14}$, and 2 x 10$^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The measured temperature-dependent resistivity showed that as the irradiation dose increased from pristine to most irradiated, the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, significantly decreased from 38.33 to 3.02 K. The crystal structures of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. The results showed that the higher the dose, the greater the change in crystal structure, such as the lattice constant and bond length. This suggests that the destruction of the crystal structure at higher doses leads to the degradation of superconductivity in the irradiated MgB$_2$ thin films. Raman spectroscopy showed that the electron-phonon coupling constant decreased with increasing irradiation dose, which was directly related to the reduction of $T_c$ in the samples. The optical conductivity indicates that the charge-carrier density of the $\sigma$-band plays an important role in the superconductivity of ion-irradiated MgB$_2$.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Re-emergent superconducting state with broken time-reversal symmetry under uniaxial stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19137v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study conditions of the appearance of \$U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2\$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. We focus on the spin-singlet s+id state. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress they exhibit linear kink and no kink otherwise. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that \$U(1)\$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper we consider effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of \$T_c^{U(1)}\$ and \$T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}\$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Ultrasound response to time-reversal symmetry breaking below the superconducting phase transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18922v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound attenuation is a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking phenomena in superconductors. In this work, we develop a framework to model the ultrasound response of multi-component superconductors undergoing a time-reversal symmetry breaking transition below the superconducting phase transition. By coupling the elastic strain of the crystal lattice to the superconducting order parameters through group-theoretical analysis of tetragonal crystals, we classify how different symmetry channels contribute to the ultrasound signal. Using a two-component Ginzburg--Landau theory, we analyze the temperature dependence of sound velocity across both superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking transitions for several cases, including $(A_{1g}, A_{1g})$, $(A_{2g}, B_{1g})$, and $E_g$ representations. Our results demonstrate that ultrasound measurements are highly sensitive to the presence of bilinear Josephson couplings and can distinguish between different realizations of the superconducting state. We further show how external strain can significantly alter the ultrasound response in systems breaking time reversal symmetry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J>0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74<a<2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a>2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a>2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19006v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite, Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O, we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f} = 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional crossover in quantum magnets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; journal version</p></details> |
| **[A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20724v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |

In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments. These papers were `Theory of spin glasses' by S.F.Edwards and P.W.Anderson (EA)[1] and `Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass', by D.Sherrington and S.Kirkpatrick (SK)[2], both concerned with trying to understand recent experiments that suggested a new phase of matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12202v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages plus references, 4 figures; supplemental materials, 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08381v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 56 figures.

| **[Time-dependent correlations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter above the spin-glass transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08955v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \times 10^{\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper with supplementary sections</p></details> |

| **[Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03123v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</p></details> |  |

A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene under strain and lattice relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19436v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model. Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now be faithfully reproduced and understood.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures plus supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, and comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Bloch: A Theoretical Blueprint for Conjugated Polymer Optoelectronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18663v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conjugated polymers are experiencing a surge of renewed interest due to their promising applications in various organic electronic devices. These include organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, among many others. Their appeal stems from distinct advantages they hold over traditional inorganic semiconductors. Unlike inorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in delocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory), electrons in conjugated polymers behave differently. They are strongly coupled within highly localized $\sigma$ or $\pi$-orbitals and interact significantly with the ionic cores. This means they are far from the idealized delocalized states presumed by Bloch's theory approaches. Consequently, after nearly a century of applying Bloch's theory to the electronic transport properties of inorganic materials, there is a clear need for a new theoretical framework to explain efficient charge transport in these organic solids. Our presented model addresses this need by incorporating crucial electron-electron interactions. Specifically, it accounts for both intra-site interactions and interactions between the $\pi$-states located at alternating sites along the polymer chain. This framework provides a many-body charge conduction mechanism and explains the semiconducting properties of the undoped material. A significant outcome of our model is the prediction of two novel flat bands of excited bonding states. Intriguingly, these states obey Bose--Einstein statistics and facilitate charge transport. Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces experimental data, providing an excellent fit for measured UV-Vis absorption and electroluminescent spectra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spin-Axis Dynamic Locking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18476v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The all-electric realization of high spin polarization and efficient charge-to-spin remains a fundamental challenge in spintronics. We report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that enables fully spin-polarized axial currents: an inplane electric field along one axis drives a pure spin-up current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates a pure spin-down current. Notably, a diagonal field produces a pure transverse spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. This originates from extremely anisotropic sublattice hopping in a 2D altermagnetic lattice, forming a "tent state" with flat bands and orthogonal Fermi contours. Our firstprinciples calculations demonstrate SADL in a broad class of altermagnetic semiconductors (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and synthesized 3D (BaF)2Mn2Se2O crystal). These materials provide ideal platforms for gate-tunable, all-electrical spintronics, enabling reconfigurable devices whose spin state is controlled solely by the orientation of an applied electric field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractional topological insulators at odd-integer filling: Phase diagram of two-valley quantum Hall model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16335v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fractional quantum Hall effect has recently been shown to exist in heterostructures of van der Waals materials without an externally applied magnetic field, e.g. in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$. These fractional Chern insulators break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously through polarization of the electron spins in a quantum spin Hall insulator band structure with flat bands. This prompts the question, which states could be realized if the spins remain unpolarized or polarize partially. Specifically, the possibility of time-reversal symmetric topological order arises. Here, we study this problem for odd integer filling of the bands, specifically focusing on vanishing and half valley polarization. Short of reliable microscopic models for small twist angles around $2.1^\circ$, we study the idealized situation of two Landau levels with opposite chirality, the two-valley quantum Hall model. Using exact diagonalization, we identify different phases arising in this model by tuning the interaction. In the physically relevant regime, the system initially exhibits phase-separated or valley-polarized states, which eventually transition into paired states by reducing onsite Coulomb repulsion.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+4 ...</summary><p>10+4 pages, 8+7 figures</p></details> |

Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin liquid.</p></details> |  |

When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Building cluster systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moiré Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18247v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures. Supplementary material: 4 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Topical review: the nature of the ground state and possibility of a quantum spin liquid in 1T metal dichalcogenides](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17419v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 24 figures.

We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16758v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 16 figures including the supplemental materials</p></details> |

The partial substitution of Rh by Pd in CeRh$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$Sn enlarges the unit-cell volume, suppresses valence fluctuations, decreases the Kondo temperature and stabilizes a possible long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state with $T_N=0.8$ K at $x=0.5$. Previous thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for $x=0.1$ suggested a quantum critical spin liquid. We report low-temperature dilatometry and magnetization measurements on CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn and compare with published low-$T$ specific heat data. The absence of a Gr\"uneisen parameter divergence excludes a conventional quantum criticality scenario. Instead, the weak power-law divergences signal non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, according to a disorder-driven quantum Griffiths phase scenario. At low temperatures, a negative thermal expansion is found in fields above approximately 0.5 T and the NFL scaling breaks down, probably due to the polarization of AFM correlations.</p></details> |  |
