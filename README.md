| **[Distinct Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Thermoelectric Transport Across Superconducting Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20792v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the relaxation dynamics of heat transport in superconductors, shaped by the interplay of diffusion, nonlinearity, and magnetic fields. Focusing on regimes near the critical temperature Tc, we analyze two classes of relaxation diffusion equations that give rise to qualitatively distinct dynamics, which we denote as Type I (linear) and Type II (nonlinear). Type I relaxation, characteristic of the normal state above Tc, results in a steady and spatially uniform heat current governed by linear diffusion. By contrast, Type II relaxation, relevant below Tc, exhibits non steady dynamics marked by pronounced spatial inhomogeneities and an evolving pattern, in which an initially localized hot spot propagates transiently through the system. The striking distinction between these regimes underscores a fundamental shift in transport mechanisms across the superconducting phase transition and provides experimentally relevant predictions in light of emerging techniques for probing local dissipation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Josephson Diode Effect from Nonequilibrium Current in a Superconducting Interferometer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00085v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Interfacing Rydberg atoms with a chip-based superconducting microwave resonator using an ac Stark shifted single-photon transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20292v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Helium atoms in the 1s50s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level have been resonantly coupled to the $2\pi\times11.721$ GHz second harmonic mode of a chip-based superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. To achieve this, the single-photon electric-dipole-allowed 1s50s $^3$S$_1\rightarrow$ 1s50p $^3$P$_J$ transition was tuned into resonance with the resonator mode through the ac Stark shift induced by a second strong $2\pi\times3.350$ GHz microwave dressing field. The effects of this dressing field, and residual uncanceled dc electric fields at the location of the atoms close to the superconducting chip surface were interpreted with support from Floquet calculations of the energy level structure of the Rydberg states. To observe appreciable population transfer in the $1~\mu$s atom-resonator interaction time using this transition, which had an electric dipole moment of $1500 e a_0$, pulsed microwave fields were injected into the resonator. From the photon occupation number in the resonator mode under these conditions, the single-photon Rabi frequency associated with the coupling of the atoms to the resonator was estimated to be $\sim2\pi\times100$ Hz. These results represent an important step toward operation of this Rydberg-atom-superconducting-circuit interface in the single-photon strong coupling regime.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Scalable Superconducting Nanowire Memory Array with Row-Column Addressing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22897v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing ultra-low-energy superconducting computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing will require scalable superconducting memory. While conventional superconducting logic-based memory cells have facilitated early demonstrations, their large footprint poses a significant barrier to scaling. Nanowire-based superconducting memory cells offer a compact alternative, but high error rates have hindered their integration into large arrays. In this work, we present a superconducting nanowire memory array designed for scalable row-column operation, achieving a functional density of 2.6$\,$Mb/cm$^{2}$. The array operates at $1.3\,$K, where we implement and characterize multi-flux quanta state storage and destructive readout. By optimizing write and read pulse sequences, we minimize bit errors while maximizing operational margins in a $4\times 4$ array. Circuit-level simulations further elucidate the memory cell's dynamics, providing insight into performance limits and stability under varying pulse amplitudes. We experimentally demonstrate stable memory operation with a minimum bit error rate of $10^{-5}$. These results suggest a promising path for scaling superconducting nanowire memories to high-density architectures, offering a foundation for energy-efficient memory in superconducting electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</p></details> | <details><summary>13(+1...</summary><p>13(+19 pages appendix), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[On-demand analog space-time in superconducting networks: grey holes, dynamical instability and exceptional points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01261v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, Submission to SciPost</p></details> |
| **[Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures in main text</p></details> |

| **[Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5+4...</summary><p>4.5+4.5 pages, 2+2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20724v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review B</p></details> |
| **[Non-classical optimization of entangled photons through complex media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24283v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observation of hysteresis in an isolated quantum system of disordered Heisenberg spins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18197v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 supplement</p></details> |
| **[Bias-Field Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Binary Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04477v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications. While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator. Our results show that BF-DCQO offers an effective path for solving large-scale HUBO problems on current and near-term quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 13 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Correlation thresholds in the steady states of particle systems and spin glasses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16497v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Signatures of spin-glass superconductivity in nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16412v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A flat band with Chern number $C=0$, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such a trivial flat band, using large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) and infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. The $C=0$ isolated flat band is hosted by an anisotropic fluxed dice lattice. Both the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the $C=0$ flat band have a sharp peak at the $\Gamma$ point, whereas in the rest of the Brillouin zone (BZ) they mimic the quantum geometry of the lowest Landau level. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure the isolated-band limit is always satisfied. From the projected ED simulations at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$ electron filling of the flat band (i.e. $1/3$ hole filling), we find the unexpected FCI with 3-fold ground-state degeneracy and $\sigma_\mathrm{H}=-1/3 (e^2/h)$. The momentum space carrier distribution shows that the quantum metric peak tends to push the interacting holes away from $\Gamma$ point towards the BZ regions with the nearly ``ideal'' quantum geometry, underlying the formation of FCI in the $C=0$ flat band. Besides, when tuning the single-particle anisotropy such that the quantum geometry of the $C=0$ flat band becomes less sharp around $\Gamma$, we find the ground state becomes a charge density wave with tripled unit cell at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$. Our two-band iDMRG simulations further corroborate the FCI in the isolated $C=0$ flat band, demonstrating in such parameter regime the fractionally quantized charge pumping upon flux insertion as well as the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum characteristic of the $1/3$ Laughlin state.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 20 Figures.

| **[Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electrical lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13571v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13302v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnetic Field Induced Band Deformation in a Lieb Lattice:Aharonov-Bohm Caging and Zeeman Splitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20451v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flat-band systems are highly sensitive to external perturbations, providing a route to study unconventional localization, transport, and spin physics. Lieb lattice, a two-dimensional geometry with an inherent flat band, exemplifies this behavior and is experimentally realizable in ultracold atoms, photonic arrays, and superconducting circuits. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of magnetic field induced band deformation in the Lieb lattice by jointly considering orbital Peierls phases and Zeeman spin splitting. A perpendicular magnetic flux generates Aharonov Bohm caging, confining particles into localized flat-band states, while Zeeman coupling lifts spin degeneracy and induces spin-resolved energy shifts. The competition between these two mechanisms gives rise to rich band restructuring and tunable spin-selective flat-band phenomena. These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable setting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and superconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation and the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled engineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic quantum matter.</p></details> | 11 pages;6 figures |
| **[Klein tunneling in deformed honeycomb-dice lattice: from massless to massive particles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10144v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Thermoelectric evidence of the electronic structure changes from the charge-density-wave transition in FeGe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19116v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.</p></details> | 4 figures |

Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in the strong-coupling regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron attractive interaction, in the case when the increase of the interaction strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that this state can be characterized by a pseudogap which is determined by the electron scattering by phase fluctuations. At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18692v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Emergent topology of flat bands in a twisted bilayer $α$-$T_3$ lattice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18657v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate an interesting interplay of destructive interference due to lattice geometry and band folding due to enlargement of the Brillouin zone in generating and subsequently modifying the band topology in a twisted bilayer $\alpha$-$T_3$ system. The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where $\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band folding on the width of the topological band.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
