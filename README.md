| **[Simulating superconductivity in mixed-dimensional $t_\parallel$-${J}_\parallel$-${J}_\perp$ bilayers with neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10091v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, we study a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t_\parallel$-$J_\parallel$-$J_\perp$ model, which has been proposed as an effective low-energy description of LNO. Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\times 8\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[Magneto-optical study of Nb thin films for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10010v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the recognized sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits, the spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting state and the possible presence of magnetic-flux vortices remain comparatively underexplored. Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superconducting Dome in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ Thin Films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15284v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the phase diagram and reveal the superconducting dome with an electron-hole crossover in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content. The maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$) coincides with an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Pressure dependent topological, superconducting, optoelectronic and thermophysical properties of Ta2Se chalcogenide: Theoretical insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09727v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tetragonal Ta2Se is a layered, Ta-rich chalcogenide that departs from conventional MX2 transition-metal dichalcogenides by hosting dense Ta-Ta networks capped by Se square-net layers. Here, we present a unified first-principles investigation of hydrostatic-pressure tuning in Ta2Se from 0 to 10 GPa, connecting the structural response, mechanical stability, thermophysical indicators, bonding evolution, electronic and optical behavior, lattice dynamics and superconductivity within a single framework. The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Grüneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability. Electron-phonon coupling calculations classify Ta2Se as a weak-coupling, phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc around 3.9 K, consistent with available experiments and establish pressure as a practical control knob for stability and superconductivity-relevant descriptors in this metal-rich layered platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09654v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical conductivity signatures of strong correlations and multiband superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09567v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 < x < 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 45 references</p></details> |
| **[Fluorine-substitution-dependent phase diagram and superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides synthesized by a high-pressure growth technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples (x = 0.05 to 0.40) are synthesized by an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa and systematically characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. Structural analysis confirms that the tetragonal Sm1111 phase remains dominant across the entire substitution range, with lattice parameters decreasing smoothly as fluorine content increases, demonstrating effective incorporation of F even in the overdoped regime (x = 0.4). Raman spectroscopy provides complementary, local-phase-sensitive evidence that supports the structural analysis and confirms fluorine substitution in the main Sm1111 phase. In the underdoped region, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with conventionally synthesized samples at the ambient pressure. The upper critical field, estimated using the WHH model, reaches values approaching 200 T, reflecting strong paramagnetic limitation and multiband effects. TAFF analysis reveals a power-law field dependence of the activation energy, consistent with collective vortex pinning in polycrystalline iron-based superconductors. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. Comparison with conventionally synthesized Sm1111 samples demonstrates that high-pressure growth significantly extends the effective fluorine substitution range and enhances the superconducting performance, particularly in the underdoped regime. These results establish high-pressure fluorine substitution as an effective materials-engineering approach for tuning the phase diagram and optimizing the superconducting properties of Sm1111.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures Accepted for publication in "Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics"</p></details> |
| **[Josephson tunneling through a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state: Interplay of $π$-shifts in Josephson current and local superconducting order parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08827v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23928v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-1 chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we identify a manifold consisting of the two lowest-lying, spin-singlet states isolated from doublet states of opposite fermion parity, which undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random Zeeman and/or spin-orbit coupling. Despite the unavoidable effect of quasiparticle poisoning on qubit performance, the isolation of the singlet states offers additional protection. In addition, we introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[Ground-state phases of $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg models on the body-centered cubic lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10008v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating low-temperature properties of three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets is challenging due to the sign problem and the system sizes required to mitigate substantial finite-size effects. However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Raman Spectroscopic Investigation of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09709v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum spin liquids, a highly topologically entangled, dynamically correlated state where quantum fluctuations preclude any long-range ordering down to absolute zero. In the search for a topologically robust qubit, the scientific community has been in continuous hunt for real quantum spin liquid systems. Alexei Kitaev in his exactly solvable model for a spin-1/2 two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, presented a system that hosts a topologically protected state (Majorana zero-modes). Under an applied external field, the Kitaev spin liquids turn into a topologically non-trivial chiral spin-liquid state with non-abelian anionic excitations, which is crucial for quantum computing. Earlier theoretical predictions advocated that Kitaev physics can be realized in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators such as honeycomb irradiates and ruthenates. However, the experimental findings continuously challenge the theoretical aspects, indicating the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in real materials, where the dimensionality, disorder (vacancy), chemical composition, generalized spin-S, and external perturbations (pressure, magnetic field, temperature) can actively tune the Kitaev interactions and the ground state excitations. In this review article, a comprehensive discussion is included with an updated literature survey in the context of the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a probe for Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

Collective excitations play a vital role in shaping our understanding of these exotic quantum phases of matter and their quantum phase transitions. While the magneto-roton and long-wavelength chiral graviton modes in the FQH liquids have been extensively explored, the collective excitations of CSLs remain elusive. Here we explore the collective excitations in the SU(2) symmetric CSL phase of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1-J_2-J_χ$ model, where an intriguing quantum phase diagram was recently revealed. Combining exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle calculations, we observe two spin-singlet collective modes: a chiral p-wave (low-energy) roton mode at finite momentum and a elliptically polarized d-wave (higher-energy) nematic mode at zero momentum, both of which are prominent across the CSL phase. Such exotic modes exhibit fingerprints distinct from those of FQH liquids, and to the best of our knowledge, are reported for the first time. By tuning $J_2$, we find the nematic mode to be pronouncedly soft, together with the spin-triplet two-spinon bound states, potentially promoting strong nematic and spin stripe instabilities. Our work paves the way for further understanding CSL from the dynamical perspective and provides new spectroscopic signatures for future experiments of CSL candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+5 p...</summary><p>5+5 pages, 5+8 figures</p></details> |

Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Hall to Chiral Spin Liquid transition in a Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19907v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $π$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+4 ...</summary><p>12+4 pages, 12+7 figures, minor changes, accepted version</p></details> |

Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.</p></details> |  |

These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version. 9 pages, 3 figures + 13 pages of Supplementary</p></details> |

However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate both the {\em stability} and {\em spatial distribution} of entanglement for the Kitaev model of QSL, which is made {\em open} by its sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and then time-evolved in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. From the time-dependent density matrix of QSL subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and the expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: ({\em i}) in the Markovian regime, it remains nonzero only in hexagonal loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs), eventually vanishing on the same timescale on which the EV of the Wilson loop operator vanishes; ({\em ii}) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, surprisingly, GMN remains nonzero up to much higher temperatures while also remaining zero in non-loopy subregions. In addition, the non-Markovian dynamics generates emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via engineering of dissipation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 119 references, Supplemental Material with additional figures and derivation is available from this https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/qttg/Publications</p></details> |
| **[Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</p></details> |  |

In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</p></details> |  |

Our comprehensive study employs three approaches: the level-spectroscopy method, Monte Carlo simulations, and a machine-learning phase classification technique. In this system, we observe two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. We present a phase diagram consisting of three phases: the low-temperature ordered phase with sublattice magnetizations, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase, as a function of the ratio of the NNN interaction to the NN interaction. We verify the six-state clock universality through the machine-learning study, which uses data from the six-state clock model on the kagome lattice for training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Kagome Superconductors YRu3B2 and LuRu3B2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16945v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $λ$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</p></details> |  |

To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, APL Materials 14, 011114 (2026)</p></details> |
| **[Competing Ordering Modes in the Distorted Quantum Kagome Material Clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21024v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Layered Kagome Strip Structure Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2: Static and Dynamic Magnetic Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18717v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-dimensional kagome strip chains share much of the same frustrated structural motif as two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, making them valuable for deepening our understanding of kagome lattice magnetism. In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unusual Dual Flat Bands and two-dimensional Dirac-node Arc State in Kagome Metal Ni3In2S2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18317v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kagome materials are at the frontier of condensed matter physics. An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
